            <h2>Why Build Another REST Framework?</h2>
            <p>
                To support <a href="https://stablekernel.com">our primary business of building native mobile
                applications</a>, we've written a lot of server code.
                And we've done this in a number of languages - Go, JavaScript, Erlang, C# and Java - all of which we've
                enjoyed for different reasons.
                As developers, we know that switching contexts is costly. Aqueduct's intent is to reduce that cost
                for our team of primarily mobile developers with a framework that feels more like iOS+Swift and
                Android+Kotlin.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reducing the cost of context-switching alone isn't everything - we also know a few other things lead to
                project success.

            <h3>Consistent Interfaces</h3>
            <p>
                As iOS and Android developers, we've been spoiled by tightly integrated, consistent frameworks. Once
                you've learned
                how to use these frameworks, you can generally guess how their other features work. This boils down to
                employing design patterns
                and naming conventions consistently. Aqueduct strives for this same consistency.
            </p>
            <p>
                A consistent interface means you don't have to read a lot of conceptual documentation or look on
                StackOverflow to use a feature of the framework.
                For example, types with the word 'Controller' in them all serve a similar purpose in Aqueduct. Instead
                of searching
                the entire <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dartdocs.org/documentation/aqueduct/latest/">API Reference</a> for a type to use, a developer can filter their search to a subset of types
                with 'Controller' behavior.
                This is the same optimization behind traversing a search tree instead of a scanning a list, but for us humans.

            <h3>Meta-programming</h3>
            <p>
                Meta-programming allows us to declare the behavior we want, without necessarily writing all of the code
                to get
                that behavior. This is valuable because it reduces both programmer fatigue and mistakes. For common
                tasks,
                this is a big productivity boost.
            </p>
            <p>
                While Aqueduct has many <a target="_blank" href="/docs/http/http_controller">meta-programming features</a>, it doesn't prevent low-level access. Whether that is
                using the standard
                Dart library to handle an HTTP request or writing raw SQL, abstractions are there when you need them and
                can be pushed aside
                when they get in the way.

            <h3>Automated Testing</h3>
            <p>
                As mobile developers, we know that time is easily lost to broken or inconsistent REST APIs.
                Using a client application
                to test the validity of a server application is unproductive. We wanted something better.
            </p>
            <p>
                Testing is a first-class citizen in
                Aqueduct; tests
                are both easy to write and run (locally and in continuous integration tooling). We know that when we
                write Aqueduct code, we can trust that client development goes smoothly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aqueduct itself is well tested, too; we simply can't afford to ship releases that break the applications
                that we maintain for our clients.

            <h3>Quick Start and the Learning Curve</h3>
            <p>
                The ability to quickly get feedback and explore an idea is key to mastering a skill. Aqueduct's tooling,
                templates
                and built-in features make creating, modifying and running a new project very quick.

            <h3>Speed</h3>
            <p>
                We built Aqueduct from the ground up to run on multiple threads without
                having to write any additional code. Even a programmer that hasn't yet learned the pitfalls of
                concurrency can reap the speed benefits
                of multiple CPUs without trouble. Alongside the high performance C/C++ Dart VM, Aqueduct
                applications deliver on speed.
