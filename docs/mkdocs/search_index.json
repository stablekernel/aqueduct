            "text": "Resources\n\n\nResources are the things your application exposes through its HTTP API. A resource can be anything - a user profile in an application, a temperature sensor in Antarctica, or a high score for a game. For example, the GitHub API exposes organization, repository, issue and pull request resources; a social network API has profiles, posts, and user relationships.\n\n\nResources are organized into collections (e.g., all of the posts), for which individual resources within that collection can be uniquely identified (e.g., a single post). Requests are made to an application to retrieve the state of a resource or to provide the desired state of a resource. Most often, resources are represented as JSON arrays and objects. When retrieving a resource, its JSON representation is encoded into the response body. When providing the desired state of a resource, a client sends the JSON representation of the desired resource state in the request body.\n\n\nFor more details on the concept of a resource, see the \nRFC Specification for HTTP/1.1\n.\n\n\nRouting\n\n\nResources are identified by the path of an HTTP request. For example, the URL \nhttp://example.com/organizations\n identifies the collection of organization resources on the server \nhttp://example.com\n. The URL \nhttp://example.com/organizations/1\n identifies a single organization.\n\n\nAn application exposes \nroutes\n for each resource it manages. A route is a string that matches the path of a request. When a request's path matches a route, the associated handler is invoked to handle the request. Routes look like paths, but have some additional syntax. For example, the route \n/organizations\n will match requests with the path \n/organizations\n. The route \n/organizations/:id\n will match the paths \n/organizations/1\n, \n/organizations/2\n, and so on.\n\n\nComplex routes can be formed with additional syntax. See the guide on \nrouting\n for usage details.\n\n\nControllers\n\n\nControllers are objects that handle requests. For example, a controller might fetch rows from a database and send them to the client in the response body. Another controller might verify the username and password of a request's Authorization header are valid.\n\n\nControllers are linked together to form a series of actions to take for a request. These linked together controllers are called a \nchannel\n. If the above examples were linked together, the channel would check if a request were authorized before it sent a response containing database rows.\n\n\nThere are two flavors of controllers. An \nendpoint controller\n performs operations on a resource or resource collection, and always sends a response. Endpoint controllers \nfulfill\n requests by returning the state of a resource or by changing the state of a resource. You write most of your application-specific logic endpoint controllers.\n\n\nA \nmiddleware controller\n takes an action for a request, but isn't responsible for fulfilling the request. Middleware controllers can do many different things and are often reusable in many channels. Most often, a middleware controller validates something about a request before it reaches an endpoint controller. Middleware controllers can send a response for a request, and doing so prevents any other controller in that channel from handling the request.\n\n\nA channel must have exactly one endpoint controller. It can be preceded by zero or more middleware controllers. See the guides on \nControllers\n and \nResourceControllers\n for usage details.\n\n\nThe Application Channel\n\n\nThe application channel is an object that contains all of the controllers in an application. It designates one controller as the first controller to receive every request called its \nentry point\n. Controllers are linked to the entry point (directly or transitively) to form the entire application channel. In nearly every application, the entry point is a router; this controller splits the channel into sub-channels for a given route.\n\n\nThe application channel is also responsible for initializing the application's services, reading configuration files and other startup related tasks. See the guide on the \nApplication Channel\n for more details.\n\n\nServices\n\n\nA service is an object that encapsulates complex tasks or algorithms, external communication or tasks that will be reused across an application. The purpose of a service object is to provide a simple interface to more detailed behavior. For example, a database connection is a service object; a user of a database connection doesn't know the details of how the connection is made or how to encode the query onto the wire, but it can still execute queries.\n\n\nThe primary user of service objects are controllers. Services are injected into controllers by passing them as arguments to the controller's constructor. The controller keeps a reference to the service, so that it can use it when handling a request.\n\n\nFor more details on injecting services, see the guide on the \nApplication Channel\n.\n\n\nIsolates\n\n\nIsolates are memory-isolated threads; an object created on one isolate can't be referenced by another isolate. When an application starts, one or more isolates containing replicas of your application code are spawned. This behavior effectively 'load balances' your application across multiple threads.\n\n\nA benefit to this structure is that each isolate has its own set of services, like database connections. This eliminates the need for techniques like 'database connection pooling', because the entire application is effectively 'pooled'.\n\n\nBindings\n\n\nA request might contain headers, query parameters, a body and path parameters that need to be parsed, validated and used in controller code. Bindings are annotations added to variables that perform this parsing and validation automatically. Appropriate error responses are sent when a bound value can't be parsed into expected type or validation fails.\n\n\nBindings cut down on boiler plate code and reduce testing surface, making development faster and code easier to reason about. For more information on bindings, see the guide on \nResource Controllers\n.\n\n\nQueries and Data Models\n\n\nApplication store information in databases for persistence. Writing database queries by hand is error-prone and doesn't leverage static analysis tools that are so valuable in a Dart application. Aqueduct's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) provides statically-typed queries that are easy to write and test.\n\n\nYour application's data model is defined by creating Dart classes. Each class is mapped to a database table, and each property of that class is mapped to a column in that table. Aqueduct's command-line tool generates database migration files that detect changes in your data model that can be applied to a live, versioned database. A data model can also be represented as a JSON object to build tools on top of your application.\n\n\nFor more details, see the guide on \nAuthorization\n.\n\n\nAuthorization\n\n\nOAuth 2.0 is a standardized authorization framework. Aqueduct contains a specification-compliant implementation of an OAuth 2.0 server that can be integrated directly into your application, or stood up alone to provide an authorization server for federated services. This implementation is easily customizable - it can store authorization artifacts - like tokens and client identifiers - in different types of databases or use stateless authorization mechanisms like JWT. The default implementation leverages the Aqueduct ORM to store artifacts in PostgreSQL.\n\n\nFor more details, see the guide on \nDatabases\n.\n\n\nDocumentation\n\n\nOpenAPI 3.0 is a standardized documentation format for HTTP APIs. Many built-in Aqueduct objects support 'automatic' documentation. Objects that are specific to your application can build on top of this to immediately document your application for every change you make.\n\n\nFor more details, see the guide on \nOpenAPI Documentation\n.",

Then, create a database that your application will connect to and a user that it will connect with:  CREATE   DATABASE   my_database_name ;  CREATE   USER   dart_app   WITH   PASSWORD   dart ;  GRANT   ALL   ON   DATABASE   my_database_name   TO   dart_app ;   An application must create a  ManagedContext  that handles the connection to this database:  class   MyChannel   extends   ApplicationChannel   { \n   ManagedContext   context ; \n\n   @ override \n   Future   prepare ()   async   { \n     var   dataModel   =   new   ManagedDataModel . fromCurrentMirrorSystem (); \n     var   store   =   new   PostgreSQLPersistentStore . fromConnectionInfo ( \n       dart_app ,   dart ,   localhost ,   5432 ,   my_database_name ); \n     context   =   new   ManagedContext ( dataModel ,   store ); \n   } \n\n   ...  }   Once you have declared  ManagedObject s in your application, generate the database schema by generating and executing migrations from your project's directory:  aqueduct db generate\naqueduct db upgrade --connect postgres://dart_app:dart@localhost:5432/my_database_name  See the guides on  connecting to a database  and  testing with a database  for more details on configuring a database connection.",

If an exception is thrown in your controller code, a response with an appropriate error code is returned. You subclass \nHandlerException\n to provide error response customization for application-specific exceptions.\n\n\nResourceControllers\n\n\nResourceControllers\n are the most often used controller. Each operation - e.g. \nPOST /projects\n, \nGET /projects\n and \nGET /projects/1\n - is mapped to methods in a subclass.

They do not need to be subclassed, but can be to provide customization.\n\n\nrouter\n\n  \n.\nroute\n(\n/users/[:id]\n)\n\n  \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nManagedObjectController\nProject\n(\ncontext\n));\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nAn application's configuration is written in a YAML file. Each environment your application runs in (e.g., locally, under test, production, development) has different values for things like the port to listen on and database connection credentials. The format of a configuration file is defined by your application. An example looks like:\n\n\n// config.yaml\ndatabase:\n  host: api.projects.com\n  port: 5432\n  databaseName: project\nport: 8000\n\n\n\n\n\nSubclass \nConfiguration\n and declare a property for each key in your configuration file:\n\n\nclass\n \nTodoConfig\n \nextends\n \nConfiguration\n \n{\n\n  \nTodoConfig\n(\nString\n \npath\n)\n \n:\n \nsuper\n.\nfromFile\n(\nFile\n(\npath\n));\n\n\n  \nDatabaseConfiguration\n \ndatabase\n;\n\n  \nint\n \nport\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default name of your configuration file is \nconfig.yaml\n, but can be changed at the command-line. You create an instance of your configuration from the configuration file path from your application options:\n\n\nimport\n \npackage:aqueduct/aqueduct.dart\n;\n\n\n\nclass\n \nTodoApp\n \nextends\n \nApplicationChannel\n \n{\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nFuture\n \nprepare\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nvar\n \noptions\n \n=\n \nTodoConfig\n(\noptions\n.\nconfigurationFilePath\n);\n\n    \n...\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning and Concurrency\n\n\nAqueduct applications are run with the \naqueduct serve\n command line tool. You can attach debugging and instrumentation tools and specify how many threads the application should run on:\n\n\naqueduct serve --observe --isolates 5 --port 8888\n\n\n\n\n\nAqueduct applications are multi-isolate (multi-threaded). Each isolate runs a replica of the same web server with its own set of services like database connections. This makes behavior like database connection pooling implicit.\n\n\nPostgreSQL ORM\n\n\nThe \nQuery\nT\n class configures and executes database queries. Its type argument determines what table is to be queried and the type of object you will work with in your code.\n\n\nimport\n \npackage:aqueduct/aqueduct.dart\n\n\n\nclass\n \nProjectController\n \nextends\n \nResourceController\n \n{\n\n  \nProjectController\n(\nthis\n.\ncontext\n)\n;\n\n\n  \nfinal\n \nManagedContext\n \ncontext\n;\n\n\n  \n@\nOperation\n.\nget\n()\n\n  \nFuture\nResponse\n \ngetAllProjects\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nfinal\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nProject\n(\ncontext\n);\n\n\n    \nfinal\n \nresults\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nquery\n.\nfetch\n();\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\nresults\n);\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration of the query - like its \nWHERE\n clause - are configured through a fluent, type-safe syntax. A property selector identifies which column of the table to apply an expression to. The following query fetches all project's due in the next week and includes their tasks by joining the related table.\n\n\nfinal\n \nnextWeek\n \n=\n \nDateTime\n.\nnow\n().\nadd\n(\nDuration\n(\ndays:\n \n7\n));\n\n\nfinal\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nProject\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nwhere\n((\nproject\n)\n \n=\n \nproject\n.\ndueDate\n).\nisLessThan\n(\nnextWeek\n)\n\n  \n..\njoin\n(\nset\n:\n \n(\nproject\n)\n \n=\n \nproject\n.\ntasks\n);\n\n\nfinal\n \nprojects\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nquery\n.\nfetch\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRows are inserted or updated by setting the statically-typed values of a query.\n\n\nfinal\n \ninsertQuery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nProject\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nvalues\n.\nname\n \n=\n \nBuild an aqueduct\n\n  \n..\nvalues\n.\ndueDate\n \n=\n \nDateTime\n(\nyear\n,\n \nmonth\n);\n\n\nvar\n \nnewProject\n \n=\n \nawait\n \ninsertQuery\n.\ninsert\n();\n  \n\n\nfinal\n \nupdateQuery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nProject\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nwhere\n((\nproject\n)\n \n=\n \nproject\n.\nid\n).\nequalTo\n(\nnewProject\n.\nid\n)\n\n  \n..\nvalues\n.\nname\n \n=\n \nBuild a miniature aqueduct\n;\n\n\nnewProject\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nupdateQuery\n.\nupdateOne\n();\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nQuery\nT\ns can perform sorting, joining and paging queries.\n\n\nfinal\n \noverdueQuery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nProject\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nwhere\n((\nproject\n)\n \n=\n \nproject\n.\ndueDate\n).\nlessThan\n(\nDateTime\n().\nnow\n())\n\n  \n..\nsortBy\n((\nproject\n)\n \n=\n \nproject\n.\ndueDate\n,\n \nQuerySortOrder\n.\nascending\n)\n\n  \n..\njoin\n(\nobject:\n \n(\nproject\n)\n \n=\n \nproject\n.\nowner\n);\n\n\n\nfinal\n \noverdueProjectsAndTheirOwners\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nquery\n.\nfetch\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControllers will interpret exceptions thrown by queries to return an appropriate error response to the client. For example, unique constraint conflicts return 409, missing required properties return 400 and database connection failure returns 503.\n\n\nDefining a Data Model\n\n\nTo use the ORM, you declare your tables as Dart types and create a subclass of \nManagedObject\nT\n. A subclass maps to a table in the database, each instance maps to a row, and each property is a column. The following declaration will map to a table named \n_project\n with columns \nid\n, \nname\n and \ndueDate\n.\n\n\nclass\n \nProject\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_Project\n \nimplements\n \n_Project\n \n{\n\n  \nbool\n \nget\n \nisPastDue\n \n=\n \ndueDate\n.\ndifference\n(\nDateTime\n.\nnow\n()).\ninSeconds\n \n \n0\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nclass\n \n_Project\n  \n{\n\n  \n@\nprimaryKey\n\n  \nint\n \nid\n;\n\n\n  \n@\nColumn\n(\nindexed:\n \ntrue\n)\n\n  \nString\n \nname\n;\n\n\n  \nDateTime\n \ndueDate\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManaged objects have relationships to other managed objects. Relationships can be has-one, has-many and many-to-many. A relationship is always two-sided - the related types must declare a property that references each other.\n\n\nclass\n \nProject\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_Project\n \nimplements\n \n_Project\n \n{}\n\n\nclass\n \n_Project\n \n{\n\n  \n...\n\n\n  \n// Project has-many Tasks\n\n  \nManagedSet\nTask\n \ntasks\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nclass\n \nTask\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_Task\n \nimplements\n \n_Task\n \n{}\n\n\nclass\n \n_Task\n \n{\n\n  \n...\n\n\n  \n// Task belongs to a project, maps to \nproject_id\n foreign key column\n\n  \n@\nRelate\n(\n#\ntasks\n)\n\n  \nProject\n \nproject\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManagedObject\nT\ns are serializable and can be directly read from a request body, or encoded as a response body.\n\n\nclass\n \nProjectController\n \nextends\n \nResourceController\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nOperation\n.\nput\n(\nid\n)\n\n  \nFuture\nResponse\n \nupdateProject\n(\n@\nBind\n.\npath\n(\nid\n)\n \nint\n \nprojectId\n,\n \n@\nBind\n.\nbody\n()\n \nProject\n \nproject\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nfinal\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nProject\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n      \n..\nwhere\n((\nproject\n)\n \n=\n \nproject\n.\nid\n).\nequalTo\n(\nprojectId\n)\n\n      \n..\nvalues\n \n=\n \nproject\n;\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\nawait\n \nquery\n.\nupdateOne\n());\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Migrations\n\n\nThe CLI will automatically generate database migration scripts by detecting changes to your managed objects. The following, when ran in a project directory, will generate and execute a database migration.\n\n\naqueduct db generate\naqueduct db upgrade --connect postgres://user:password@host:5432/database\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can edit migration files by hand to alter any assumptions or enter required values, and run \naqueduct db validate\n to ensure the changes still yield the same schema. Be sure to keep generated files in version control.\n\n\nOAuth 2.0\n\n\nAn OAuth 2.0 server implementation handles authentication and authorization for Aqueduct applications. You create an \nAuthServer\n and its delegate as services in your application. The delegate is configurable and manages how tokens are generated and stored. By default, access tokens are a random 32-byte string and client identifiers, tokens and access codes are stored in your database using the ORM.\n\n\nimport\n \npackage:aqueduct/aqueduct.dart\n;\n\n\nimport\n \npackage:aqueduct/managed_auth.dart\n;\n\n\n\nclass\n \nAppApplicationChannel\n \nextends\n \nApplicationChannel\n \n{\n\n  \nAuthServer\n \nauthServer\n;\n\n  \nManagedContext\n \ncontext\n;\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nFuture\n \nprepare\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \ncontext\n \n=\n \nManagedContext\n(...);\n\n\n    \nfinal\n \ndelegate\n \n=\n \nManagedAuthDelegate\nUser\n(\ncontext\n);\n\n    \nauthServer\n \n=\n \nAuthServer\n(\ndelegate\n);\n\n  \n}\n  \n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt-in authentication controllers for exchanging user credentials for access tokens are named \nAuthController\n and \nAuthCodeController\n. \nAuthorizer\ns are middleware that require a valid access token to access their linked controller.\n\n\nController\n \nget\n \nentryPoint\n \n{\n\n  \nfinal\n \nrouter\n \n=\n \nRouter\n();\n\n\n  \n// POST /auth/token with username and password (or access code) to get access token\n\n  \nrouter\n\n    \n.\nroute\n(\n/auth/token\n)\n\n    \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nAuthController\n(\nauthServer\n));\n\n\n  \n// GET /auth/code returns login form, POST /auth/code grants access code\n\n  \nrouter\n\n    \n.\nroute\n(\n/auth/code\n)\n\n    \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nAuthCodeController\n(\nauthServer\n));\n\n\n  \n// ProjectController requires request to include access token\n\n  \nrouter\n\n    \n.\nroute\n(\n/projects/[:id]\n)\n\n    \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nAuthorizer\n.\nbearer\n(\nauthServer\n))\n\n    \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nProjectController\n(\ncontext\n));\n\n\n  \nreturn\n \nrouter\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CLI has tools to manage OAuth 2.0 client identifiers and access scopes.\n\n\naqueduct auth add-client \\\n  --id com.app.mobile \\\n  --secret foobar \\\n  --redirect-uri https://somewhereoutthere.com \\\n  --allowed-scopes \nusers projects admin.readonly\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogging\n\n\nAll requests are logged to an application-wide logger.

Before your tests run, Aqueduct will create your application's database tables in a local PostgreSQL database. After the tests complete, it will delete those tables. This allows you to start with an empty database for each test suite as well as control exactly which records are in your database while testing, but without having to manage database schemas or use an mock implementation (e.g., SQLite).\n\n\nThis behavior, and behavior for managing applications with an OAuth 2.0 provider, are available as \nharness mixins\n.\n\n\nDocumentation\n\n\nOpenAPI documents describe your application's interface. These documents can be used to generate documentation and client code. A document can be generated by reflecting on your application's codebase, just run the \naqueduct document\n command.\n\n\nThe \naqueduct document client\n command creates a web page that can be used to configure issue requests specific to your application.",

            "text": "Best Practices for Developing Aqueduct Applications\n\n\nKeep Dart Projects Separate\n\n\nBecause Dart is cross-platform, developers should avoid combining client application projects with Aqueduct projects. Instead, use a single repository with an independent project for each facet of the system. When there are opportunities for code sharing between platforms (typically between Flutter and AngularDart), shared code can live in a dependency project in the same repository.\n\n\nA typical directory structure for an multi-faceted application looks like this:\n\n\napplication_name/\n  aqueduct/\n  flutter/\n  angular/\n  shared/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Definition\n\n\nA \nproject\n is a directory that contain a \npubspec.yaml\n file and \nlib\n directory.\n\n\n\n\nIt is tempting to share your data model types between your server and client applications, but this falls apart for anything but the most simple of applications. There are enough behavioral differences between the four representations of your data model - in the database, on the server, on the wire (JSON), and on the client - that a single type will have a hard time encompassing. Instead, generate an OpenAPI specification with \naqueduct document\n and use one of the many open-source tools for generating client data model types.\n\n\nUse Test Driven Development (or something close to it)\n\n\nIn Aqueduct, testing is a first-class citizen. The \naqueduct_test\n package has classes and methods for initializing and running an application for testing, making requests to that application, and verifying the responses. There is value to using tools like Postman or CURL to test proof of concept code, but the \naqueduct_test\n package is geared specifically for replacing these tools while retaining automated tests as the project grows.\n\n\nAn example test suite looks like this:\n\n\nvoid\n \nmain\n()\n \n{\n\n  \nfinal\n \nharness\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nHarness\n()..\ninstall\n();\n\n\n  \ntest\n(\nGET /endpoint returns 200 and a simple object\n,\n \n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nfinal\n \nresponse\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nharness\n.\nagent\n.\nget\n(\n/endpoint\n);\n\n    \nexpectResponse\n(\nresponse\n,\n \n200\n,\n \nbody:\n \n{\nkey\n:\n \nvalue\n});\n\n  \n});\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse a bin Script to Verify Assumptions\n\n\nKeep a simple Dart script file in the \nbin/\n directory that imports your project. Use this file as a scratchpad to test exploratory code before committing to a test suite. Don't check this file into source control.\n\n\nimport\n \npackage:myapp/myapp.dart\n;\n\n\n\nFuture\n \nmain\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n  \nvar\n \nwhatIsThis\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nsomeYetToBeNamedUsefullyMethod\n();\n\n  \nprint\n(\n$\nwhatIsThis\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate New Projects from a Template\n\n\nUse \naqueduct create\n to create applications with the appropriate structure and boilerplate. There are templates for different kinds of applications; view these templates with \naqueduct create list-templates\n.\n\n\nUse a Debugger\n\n\nA debugger allows you to stop execution of a running application at a particular line of code to verify variable values, and then continue to step through that code line by line. It can be used when running test suites or when running the application through the \nbin/main.dart\n script.\n\n\nIn IntelliJ IDEA, right-click on any file with a \nmain\n function (which includes test suites) and select \nDebug\n option. Use breakpoints (by clicking on the gutter area to the left of the text editing area) to stop execution at a particular line before it is executed.\n\n\nUse the Suggested Project Directory Structure\n\n\nSee \nAqueduct Project Structure\n.\n\n\nPass Services to Controllers in entryPoint\n\n\nPass service objects to controllers in \nentryPoint\n and only pass the services the controller will use.\n\n\nclass\n \nAppChannel\n \nextends\n \nApplicationChannel\n \n{\n\n  \nGitHub\n \ngithubService\n;\n\n  \nPostgreSQLConnection\n \ndatabaseConnection\n;\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nFuture\n \nprepare\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \ndatabaseConnection\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nPostgreSQLConnection\n();\n\n    \ngithubService\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nGitHub\n();\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nController\n \nget\n \nentryPoint\n \n{\n\n    \nfinal\n \nrouter\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nRouter\n();\n\n\n    \nrouter\n\n      \n.\nroute\n(\n/data\n)\n\n      \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nDBController\n(\ndatabaseConnection\n));\n\n\n    \nrouter\n\n      \n.\nroute\n(\n/github\n)\n\n      \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nGitHubController\n(\ngithubService\n));\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nrouter\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassing references like this allows for injecting dependencies that depend on the environment; e.g. in production, development or during tests. It also avoids tight coupling between the objects in your application.\n\n\nMinimize the access a controller has to its dependencies; e.g. don't pass it a \nStreamController\n when it only needs \nSink\n or a \nStream\n.\n\n\nUse a Test Harness\n\n\nA test harness initializes your application in a test suite. It has built in behavior that you can add to for things that are specific to your application. Documentation for using a test harness in your application is located \nhere\n.\n\n\nUse config.src.yaml\n\n\nUse the convention of \nconfig.src.yaml file\n to prevent configuration errors and inject test dependencies.\n\n\nUnderstand how Aqueduct Uses Isolates\n\n\nSee more in \nApplication Structure\n.\n\n\nUse ResourceController Subclasses\n\n\nSubclassing \nResourceController\n provides significant conveniences, safeties and behaviors used by the majority of an application's request handling logic. Prefer to use this class for non-middleware controllers.\n\n\nKeep ApplicationChannel Tidy\n\n\nA \nApplicationChannel\n should handle initialization, routing and nothing more. Consider moving non-initialization behavior into a service object in a separate file.\n\n\nAvoid Raw SQL Queries\n\n\nPrefer to use the Aqueduct ORM. It sends appropriate HTTP responses for different kinds of errors, validates input data and is ensures the queries match up with your data model.\n\n\nUse API Reference\n\n\nAqueduct is an object oriented framework - behaviors are implemented by instances of some type. The types of objects, their properties and their behaviors all follow similar naming conventions to make the API more discoverable.\n\n\nMany types in Aqueduct have a prefix in common with related types. For example, types like \nAuthServer\n, \nAuthServerDelegate\n and \nAuthCode\n are all related because they deal with authentication and authorization. Methods are named consistently across classes (e.g, \nasMap\n is a common method name).\n\n\nWhen looking for a solution, look at the \nAPI reference\n for the objects you have access to. These objects may already have the behavior you wish to implement or have a reference to an object with that behavior.\n\n\nUse try-catch Sparingly\n\n\nAll request handling code is wrapped in a try-catch block that will interpret exceptions and errors and return meaningful HTTP responses. Unknown exceptions will yield a 500 Server Error response. In general, you do not need to use try-catch unless you want a different HTTP response than the one being returned for the exception.\n\n\nCode that throws an exception during initialization should not be caught if the error is fatal to the application launching successfully.",

            "text": "1. Getting Started\n\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you will have created an Aqueduct application that serves fictional heroes from a PostgreSQL database. You will learn the following:\n\n\n\n\nRun an Aqueduct application\n\n\nRoute HTTP requests to the appropriate handler in your code\n\n\nStore and retrieve database data\n\n\nWrite automated tests for each endpoint\n\n\nRequire authorization for HTTP requests\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Help\n\n\nIf at anytime you get stuck, hop on over to the \nAqueduct Slack channel\n. You can also see a finished version of this application \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nTo get started, make sure you have the following software installed:\n\n\n\n\nDart (\nInstall Instructions\n)\n\n\nIntelliJ IDEA or any other Jetbrains IDE, including the free Community Edition (\nInstall Instructions\n)\n\n\nThe IntelliJ IDEA Dart Plugin (\nInstall Instructions\n)\n\n\n\n\nInstall the \naqueduct\n command line tool by running the following command in your shell:\n\n\npub global activate aqueduct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you get warning text about your \nPATH\n, make sure to read it before moving on.\n\n\n\n\nCreating a Project\n\n\nCreate a new project named \nheroes\n by entering the following in your shell:\n\n\naqueduct create heroes\n\n\n\n\n\nThis creates a \nheroes\n project directory. Open this directory with IntelliJ IDEA by dragging the project folder onto IntellIJ IDEA's icon.\n\n\nIn IntelliJ's project view, locate the \nlib\n directory; this is where your project's code will go. This project has two source files - \nheroes.dart\n and \nchannel.dart\n. Open the file \nheroes.dart\n. Click \nEnable Dart Support\n in the top right corner of the editor.\n\n\nHandling HTTP Requests\n\n\nIn your browser, navigate to \nhttp://aqueduct-tutorial.stablekernel.io\n. This browser application is a 'Hero Manager' - it allows a user to view, create, delete and update heroes. (It is a slightly modified version of the \nAngularDart Tour of Heroes Tutorial\n.) It will make HTTP requests to \nhttp://localhost:8888\n to fetch and manipulate hero data. The application you will build in this tutorial respond to those requests.\n\n\n\n\nRunning the Browser Application Locally\n\n\nThe browser application is served over HTTP so that it can access your Aqueduct application when it runs locally on your machine. Your browser may warn you about navigating to an insecure webpage, because it is in fact insecure. You can run this application locally by grabbing the source code from \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nIn this first chapter, you will write code to handle two requests: one to get a list of heroes, and the other to get a single hero by its identifier. Those requests are:\n\n\n\n\nGET /heroes\n to the list of heroes\n\n\nGET /heroes/:id\n to get an individual hero\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTTP Operation Shorthand\n\n\nThe term \nGET /heroes\n is called an operation. It is the combination of the HTTP method and the path of the request. Each operation is  unique to an application, so your code is segmented into units for each operation. Sections with a colon, like the ':id' segment, are  variable: they can be 1, 2, 3, and so on.\n\n\n\n\nController Objects Handle Requests\n\n\nRequests are handled by \ncontroller objects\n. A controller object can respond to a request. It can also take other action and let another controller respond. For example, it might check if the request is authorized, or send analytical data to some other service. Controllers are composed together, and each controller in the composition performs its logic in order. This allows for some controllers to be reused, and for  better code organization. A composition of controllers is called a \nchannel\n because requests flow in one direction through the controllers.\n\n\nOur application will link two controllers:\n\n\n\n\na \nRouter\n that makes sure the request path is \n/heroes\n or \n/heroes/:id\n\n\na \nHeroesControllers\n that responds with hero objects\n\n\n\n\nYour application starts with a channel object called the \napplication channel\n. You link the controllers in your application to this channel.\n\n\n\n\nEach application has a subclass of \nApplicationChannel\n that you override methods in to set up your controllers. This type is already declared in \nlib/channel.dart\n - open this file and find \nApplicationChannel.entryPoint\n:\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nController\n \nget\n \nentryPoint\n \n{\n\n    \nfinal\n \nrouter\n \n=\n \nRouter\n();\n\n\n    \nrouter\n\n      \n.\nroute\n(\n/example\n)\n\n      \n.\nlinkFunction\n((\nrequest\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n        \nreturn\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n({\nkey\n:\n \nvalue\n});\n\n      \n});\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nrouter\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen your application gets a request, the \nentryPoint\n controller is the first to handle it. In our case, this is a \nRouter\n - a subclass of \nController\n.\n\n\n\n\nController Subclassing\nEvery controller you use will be a subclass of \nController\n. There are some controller subclasses already in Aqueduct for common behaviors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou use the \nroute\n method on a router to attach a controller to a \nroute\n. A route is a string syntax that matches the path of a request. In our current implementation, the route will match every request with the path \n/example\n. When that request is received, a linked function runs and returns a 200 OK response with an example JSON object body.\n\n\nWe need to route the path \n/heroes\n to a controller of our own, so we can control what happens. Let's create a \nHeroesController\n. Create a new file in \nlib/controller/heroes_controller.dart\n and add the following code (you will need to create the subdirectory \nlib/controller/\n):\n\n\nimport\n \npackage:aqueduct/aqueduct.dart\n;\n\n\nimport\n \npackage:heroes/heroes.dart\n;\n\n\n\nclass\n \nHeroesController\n \nextends\n \nController\n \n{\n\n  \nfinal\n \n_heroes\n \n=\n \n[\n\n    \n{\nid\n:\n \n11\n,\n \nname\n:\n \nMr. Nice\n},\n\n    \n{\nid\n:\n \n12\n,\n \nname\n:\n \nNarco\n},\n\n    \n{\nid\n:\n \n13\n,\n \nname\n:\n \nBombasto\n},\n\n    \n{\nid\n:\n \n14\n,\n \nname\n:\n \nCeleritas\n},\n\n    \n{\nid\n:\n \n15\n,\n \nname\n:\n \nMagneta\n},\n    \n  \n];\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nFuture\nRequestOrResponse\n \nhandle\n(\nRequest\n \nrequest\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\n_heroes\n);\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that \nHeroesController\n is a subclass of \nController\n; this is what makes it a controller object. It overrides its \nhandle\n method by returning a \nResponse\n object. This response object has a 200 OK status code, and it body contains a JSON-encoded list of hero objects. When a controller returns a \nResponse\n object from its \nhandle\n method, it is sent to the client.\n\n\nRight now, our \nHeroesController\n isn't hooked up to the application channel. We need to link it to the router. First, import our new file at the top of \nchannel.dart\n.\n\n\nimport\n \ncontroller/heroes_controller.dart\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen link this \nHeroesController\n to the \nRouter\n for the path \n/heroes\n:\n\n\n@\noverride\n\n\nController\n \nget\n \nentryPoint\n \n{\n\n  \nfinal\n \nrouter\n \n=\n \nRouter\n();\n\n\n  \nrouter\n\n    \n.\nroute\n(\n/heroes\n)\n\n    \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nHeroesController\n());\n\n\n  \nrouter\n\n    \n.\nroute\n(\n/example\n)\n\n    \n.\nlinkFunction\n((\nrequest\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n      \nreturn\n \nnew\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n({\nkey\n:\n \nvalue\n});\n\n    \n});\n\n\n  \nreturn\n \nrouter\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now have a application that will return a list of heroes. In the project directory, run the following command from the command-line:\n\n\naqueduct serve\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will start your application running locally. Reload the browser page \nhttp://aqueduct-tutorial.stablekernel.io\n. It will make a request to \nhttp://localhost:8888/heroes\n and your application will serve it. You'll see your heroes in your web browser:\n\n\nScreenshot of Heroes Application\n\n\n\n\nYou can also see the actual response of your request by entering the following into your shell:\n\n\ncurl -X GET http://localhost:8888/heroes\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll get JSON output like this:\n\n\n[\n\n  \n{\nid\n:\n11\n,\nname\n:\nMr. Nice\n},\n\n  \n{\nid\n:\n12\n,\nname\n:\nNarco\n},\n\n  \n{\nid\n:\n13\n,\nname\n:\nBombasto\n},\n\n  \n{\nid\n:\n14\n,\nname\n:\nCeleritas\n},\n\n  \n{\nid\n:\n15\n,\nname\n:\nMagneta\n}\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll also see this request logged in the shell that you started \naqueduct serve\n in.\n\n\nLinking Controllers\n\n\nWhen a controller handles a request, it can either send a response or let one of its linked controllers handle the request. By default, a \nRouter\n will send a 404 Not Found response for any request. Adding a route to a \nRouter\n creates an entry point to a new channel that controllers can be linked to. In our application, \nHeroesController\n is linked to the route \n/heroes\n.\n\n\nControllers come in two different flavors: endpoint and middleware. Endpoint controllers, like \nHeroesController\n, always send a response. They implement the behavior that a request is seeking. Middleware controllers, like \nRouter\n, handles requests before they reach an endpoint controller. A router, for example, handles a request by directing it to the right controller. Controllers like \nAuthorizer\n verify the authorization of the request. You can create all kinds of controllers to provide any behavior you like.\n\n\nA channel can have zero or many middleware controllers, but must end in an endpoint controller. Most controllers can only have one linked controller, but a \nRouter\n allows for many. For example, a larger application might look like this:\n\n\n@\noverride\n\n\nController\n \nget\n \nentryPoint\n \n{\n\n  \nfinal\n \nrouter\n \n=\n \nRouter\n();\n\n\n  \nrouter\n\n    \n.\nroute\n(\n/users\n)\n\n    \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nAPIKeyValidator\n())\n\n    \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nAuthorizer\n.\nbearer\n())\n\n    \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nUsersController\n());\n\n\n  \nrouter\n\n    \n.\nroute\n(\n/posts\n)\n\n    \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nAPIKeyValidator\n())\n\n    \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nPostsController\n());\n\n\n  \nreturn\n \nrouter\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach of these objects is a subclass of \nController\n, giving them the ability to be linked together to handle requests. A request goes through controllers in the order they are linked. A request for the path \n/users\n will go through an \nAPIKeyValidator\n, an \nAuthorizer\n and finally a \nUsersController\n. Each of these controllers has an opportunity to respond, preventing the next controller from receiving the request.\n\n\nAdvanced Routing\n\n\nRight now, our application handles \nGET /heroes\n requests. The browser application uses the this list to populate its hero dashboard. If we click on an individual hero, the browser application will display an individual hero. When navigating to this page, the browser application makes a request to our server for an individual hero. This request contains the unique id of the selected hero in the path, e.g. \n/heroes/11\n or \n/heroes/13\n.\n\n\nOur server doesn't handle this request yet - it only handles requests that have exactly the path \n/heroes\n. Since a request for individual heroes will have a path that changes depending on the hero, we need our route to include a \npath variable\n.\n\n\nA path variable is a segment of route that matches a value for the same segment in the incoming request path. A path variable is a segment prefixed with a colon (\n:\n). For example, the route \n/heroes/:id\n contains a path variable named \nid\n. If the request path is \n/heroes/1\n, \n/heroes/2\n, and so on, the request will be sent to our \nHeroesController\n. The \nHeroesController\n will have access to the value of the path variable to determine which hero to return.\n\n\nThere's one hiccup. The route \n/heroes/:id\n no longer matches the path \n/heroes\n. It'd be a lot easier to organize our code if both \n/heroes\n and \n/heroes/:id\n went to our \nHeroesController\n; it does heroic stuff. For this reason, we can declare the \n:id\n portion of our route to be optional by wrapping it in square brackets. In \nchannel.dart\n, modify the \n/heroes\n route:\n\n\nrouter\n\n  \n.\nroute\n(\n/heroes/[:id]\n)\n\n  \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nHeroesController\n());\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the second segment of the path is optional, the path \n/heroes\n still matches the route. If the path contains a second segment, the value of that segment is bound to the path variable named \nid\n. We can access path variables through the \nRequest\n object. In \nheroes_controller.dart\n, modify \nhandle\n:\n\n\n// In just a moment, we\nll replace this code with something even better,\n\n\n// but it\ns important to understand where this information comes from first!\n\n\n@\noverride\n\n\nFuture\nRequestOrResponse\n \nhandle\n(\nRequest\n \nrequest\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n  \nif\n \n(\nrequest\n.\npath\n.\nvariables\n.\ncontainsKey\n(\nid\n))\n \n{\n\n    \nfinal\n \nid\n \n=\n \nint\n.\nparse\n(\nrequest\n.\npath\n.\nvariables\n[\nid\n]);\n\n    \nfinal\n \nhero\n \n=\n \n_heroes\n.\nfirstWhere\n((\nhero\n)\n \n=\n \nhero\n[\nid\n]\n \n==\n \nid\n,\n \norElse:\n \n()\n \n=\n \nnull\n);\n\n    \nif\n \n(\nhero\n \n==\n \nnull\n)\n \n{\n\n      \nreturn\n \nResponse\n.\nnotFound\n();\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\nhero\n);\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \nreturn\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\n_heroes\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn your shell currently running the application, hit Ctrl-C to stop the application. Then, run \naqueduct serve\n again. In the browser application, click on a hero and you will be taken to a detail page for that hero.\n\n\n\n\nYou can verify that your server is responding correctly by executing \ncurl -X GET http://localhost:8888/heroes/11\n to view the single hero object. You can also trigger a 404 Not Found response by getting a hero that doesn't exist.\n\n\nResourceControllers and Operation Methods\n\n\nOur \nHeroesController\n is OK right now, but it'll soon run into a problem: what happens when we want to create a new hero? Or update an existing hero's name? Our \nhandle\n method will start to get unmanageable, quickly.\n\n\nThat's where \nResourceController\n comes in. A \nResourceController\n allows you to create a distinct method for each operation that we can perform on our heroes. One method will handle getting a list of heroes, another will handle getting a single hero, and so on. Each method has an annotation that identifies the HTTP method and path variables the request must have to trigger it.\n\n\nIn \nheroes_controller.dart\n, replace \nHeroesController\n with the following:\n\n\nclass\n \nHeroesController\n \nextends\n \nResourceController\n \n{\n\n  \nfinal\n \n_heroes\n \n=\n \n[\n\n    \n{\nid\n:\n \n11\n,\n \nname\n:\n \nMr. Nice\n},\n\n    \n{\nid\n:\n \n12\n,\n \nname\n:\n \nNarco\n},\n\n    \n{\nid\n:\n \n13\n,\n \nname\n:\n \nBombasto\n},\n\n    \n{\nid\n:\n \n14\n,\n \nname\n:\n \nCeleritas\n},\n\n    \n{\nid\n:\n \n15\n,\n \nname\n:\n \nMagneta\n},\n\n  \n];\n\n\n  \n@\nOperation\n.\nget\n()\n\n  \nFuture\nResponse\n \ngetAllHeroes\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\n_heroes\n);\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \n@\nOperation\n.\nget\n(\nid\n)\n\n  \nFuture\nResponse\n \ngetHeroByID\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nfinal\n \nid\n \n=\n \nint\n.\nparse\n(\nrequest\n.\npath\n.\nvariables\n[\nid\n]);\n\n    \nfinal\n \nhero\n \n=\n \n_heroes\n.\nfirstWhere\n((\nhero\n)\n \n=\n \nhero\n[\nid\n]\n \n==\n \nid\n,\n \norElse:\n \n()\n \n=\n \nnull\n);\n\n    \nif\n \n(\nhero\n \n==\n \nnull\n)\n \n{\n\n      \nreturn\n \nResponse\n.\nnotFound\n();\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\nhero\n);\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that we didn't have to override \nhandle\n in \nResourceController\n. A \nResourceController\n implements this method to call one of our \noperation methods\n. An operation method - like \ngetAllHeroes\n and \ngetHeroByID\n - must have an \nOperation\n annotation. The named constructor \nOperation.get\n means these methods get called when the request's method is GET. An operation method must also return a \nFuture\nResponse\n.\n\n\ngetHeroByID\n's annotation also has an argument - the name of our path variable \nid\n. If that path variable exists in the request's path, \ngetHeroByID\n will be called. If it doesn't exist, \ngetAllHeroes\n will be called.\n\n\n\n\nNaming Operation Methods\n\n\nThe plain English phrase for an operation - like 'get hero by id' - is a really good name for an operation method and a good name will be useful when you generate OpenAPI documentation from your code.\n\n\n\n\nReload the application by hitting Ctrl-C in the terminal that ran \naqueduct serve\n and then run \naqueduct serve\n again. The browser application should still behave the same.\n\n\n\n\nBrowser Clients\n\n\nIn addition to \ncurl\n, you can create a SwaggerUI browser application that executes requests against your locally running application. In your project directory, run \naqueduct document client\n and it will generate a file named \nclient.html\n. Open this file in your browser for a UI that constructs and executes requests that your application supports.\n\n\n\n\nRequest Binding\n\n\nIn our \ngetHeroByID\n method, we make a dangerous assumption that the path variable 'id' can be parsed into an integer. If 'id' were something else, like a string, \nint.parse\n would throw an exception. When exceptions are thrown in operation methods, the controller catches it and sends a 500 Server Error response. 500s are bad, they don't tell the client what's wrong. A 404 Not Found is a better response here, but writing the code to catch that exception and create this response is cumbersome.\n\n\nInstead, we can rely on a feature of operation methods called \nrequest binding\n. An operation method can declare parameters and \nbind\n them to properties of the request. When our operation method gets called, it will be passed values from the request as arguments. Request bindings automatically parse values into the type of the parameter (and return a better error response if parsing fails). Change the method \ngetHeroByID()\n:\n\n\n@\nOperation\n.\nget\n(\nid\n)\n\n\nFuture\nResponse\n \ngetHeroByID\n(\n@\nBind\n.\npath\n(\nid\n)\n \nint\n \nid\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n  \nfinal\n \nhero\n \n=\n \n_heroes\n.\nfirstWhere\n((\nhero\n)\n \n=\n \nhero\n[\nid\n]\n \n==\n \nid\n,\n \norElse:\n \n()\n \n=\n \nnull\n);\n\n\n  \nif\n \n(\nhero\n \n==\n \nnull\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \nResponse\n.\nnotFound\n();\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \nreturn\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\nhero\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe value of the path variable \nid\n will be parsed as an integer and be available to this method in the \nid\n parameter. The \n@Bind\n annotation on an operation method parameter tells Aqueduct the value from the request we want bound. Using the named constructor \nBind.path\n binds a path variable, and the name of that variable is indicated in the argument to this constructor.\n\n\nYou can bind path variables, headers, query parameters and bodies. When binding path variables, we have to specify which path variable with the argument to \n@Bind.path(pathVariableName)\n.\n\n\n\n\nBound Parameter Names\n\n\nThe name of a bound parameter doesn't have to match the name of the path variable. We could have declared it as \n@Bind.path('id') int heroID\n. Only the argument to \nBind\n's constructor must match the actual name of the path variable. This is valuable for other types of bindings, like headers, that may contain characters that aren't valid Dart variable names, e.g. \nX-API-Key\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe More You Know: Multi-threading and Application State\n\n\nIn this simple exercise, we used a constant list of heroes as our source of data. For a simple getting-your-feet-wet demo, this is fine. However, in a real application, you'd store this data in a database. That way you could add data to it and not risk losing it when the application was restarted.\n\n\nMore generally, a web server should never hang on to data that can change. While previously just a best practice, stateless web servers are becoming a requirement with the prevalence of containerization and tools like Kubernetes. Aqueduct makes it a bit easier to detect violations of this rule with its multi-threading strategy.\n\n\nWhen you run an Aqueduct application, it creates multiple threads. Each of these threads has its own isolated heap in memory; meaning data that exists on one thread can't be accessed from other threads. In Dart, these isolated threads are called \nisolates\n.\n\n\nAn instance of your application channel is created for each isolate. Each HTTP request is given to just one of the isolates to be handled. In a sense, your one application behaves the same as running your application on multiple servers behind a load balancer. (It also makes your application substantially faster.)\n\n\nIf you are storing any data in your application, you'll find out really quick. Why? A request that changes data will only change that data in one of your application's isolates. When you make a request to get that data again, its unlikely that you'll see the changes - another isolate with different data will probably handle that request.\n\n\nNext Chapter: Reading from a Database",

For example, it might check if the request is authorized, or send analytical data to some other service. Controllers are composed together, and each controller in the composition performs its logic in order. This allows for some controllers to be reused, and for  better code organization. A composition of controllers is called a  channel  because requests flow in one direction through the controllers.  Our application will link two controllers:   a  Router  that makes sure the request path is  /heroes  or  /heroes/:id  a  HeroesControllers  that responds with hero objects   Your application starts with a channel object called the  application channel . You link the controllers in your application to this channel.   Each application has a subclass of  ApplicationChannel  that you override methods in to set up your controllers. This type is already declared in  lib/channel.dart  - open this file and find  ApplicationChannel.entryPoint :     @ override \n   Controller   get   entryPoint   { \n     final   router   =   Router (); \n\n     router \n       . route ( /example ) \n       . linkFunction (( request )   async   { \n         return   Response . ok ({ key :   value }); \n       }); \n\n     return   router ; \n   }   When your application gets a request, the  entryPoint  controller is the first to handle it. In our case, this is a  Router  - a subclass of  Controller .   Controller Subclassing Every controller you use will be a subclass of  Controller . There are some controller subclasses already in Aqueduct for common behaviors.    You use the  route  method on a router to attach a controller to a  route . A route is a string syntax that matches the path of a request. In our current implementation, the route will match every request with the path  /example . When that request is received, a linked function runs and returns a 200 OK response with an example JSON object body.  We need to route the path  /heroes  to a controller of our own, so we can control what happens. Let's create a  HeroesController . Create a new file in  lib/controller/heroes_controller.dart  and add the following code (you will need to create the subdirectory  lib/controller/ ):  import   package:aqueduct/aqueduct.dart ;  import   package:heroes/heroes.dart ;  class   HeroesController   extends   Controller   { \n   final   _heroes   =   [ \n     { id :   11 ,   name :   Mr. Nice }, \n     { id :   12 ,   name :   Narco }, \n     { id :   13 ,   name :   Bombasto }, \n     { id :   14 ,   name :   Celeritas }, \n     { id :   15 ,   name :   Magneta },     \n   ]; \n\n   @ override \n   Future RequestOrResponse   handle ( Request   request )   async   { \n     return   Response . ok ( _heroes ); \n   }  }   Notice that  HeroesController  is a subclass of  Controller ; this is what makes it a controller object. It overrides its  handle  method by returning a  Response  object. This response object has a 200 OK status code, and it body contains a JSON-encoded list of hero objects. When a controller returns a  Response  object from its  handle  method, it is sent to the client.  Right now, our  HeroesController  isn't hooked up to the application channel. We need to link it to the router. First, import our new file at the top of  channel.dart .  import   controller/heroes_controller.dart ;   Then link this  HeroesController  to the  Router  for the path  /heroes :  @ override  Controller   get   entryPoint   { \n   final   router   =   Router (); \n\n   router \n     . route ( /heroes ) \n     . link (()   =   HeroesController ()); \n\n   router \n     . route ( /example ) \n     . linkFunction (( request )   async   { \n       return   new   Response . ok ({ key :   value }); \n     }); \n\n   return   router ;  }   We now have a application that will return a list of heroes. In the project directory, run the following command from the command-line:  aqueduct serve  This will start your application running locally.

Each of these controllers has an opportunity to respond, preventing the next controller from receiving the request.",

            "text": "Right now, our application handles  GET /heroes  requests. The browser application uses the this list to populate its hero dashboard. If we click on an individual hero, the browser application will display an individual hero. When navigating to this page, the browser application makes a request to our server for an individual hero. This request contains the unique id of the selected hero in the path, e.g.  /heroes/11  or  /heroes/13 .  Our server doesn't handle this request yet - it only handles requests that have exactly the path  /heroes . Since a request for individual heroes will have a path that changes depending on the hero, we need our route to include a  path variable .  A path variable is a segment of route that matches a value for the same segment in the incoming request path. A path variable is a segment prefixed with a colon ( : ). For example, the route  /heroes/:id  contains a path variable named  id . If the request path is  /heroes/1 ,  /heroes/2 , and so on, the request will be sent to our  HeroesController . The  HeroesController  will have access to the value of the path variable to determine which hero to return.  There's one hiccup. The route  /heroes/:id  no longer matches the path  /heroes . It'd be a lot easier to organize our code if both  /heroes  and  /heroes/:id  went to our  HeroesController ; it does heroic stuff. For this reason, we can declare the  :id  portion of our route to be optional by wrapping it in square brackets. In  channel.dart , modify the  /heroes  route:  router \n   . route ( /heroes/[:id] ) \n   . link (()   =   HeroesController ());   Since the second segment of the path is optional, the path  /heroes  still matches the route. If the path contains a second segment, the value of that segment is bound to the path variable named  id . We can access path variables through the  Request  object. In  heroes_controller.dart , modify  handle :  // In just a moment, we ll replace this code with something even better,  // but it s important to understand where this information comes from first!  @ override  Future RequestOrResponse   handle ( Request   request )   async   { \n   if   ( request . path . variables . containsKey ( id ))   { \n     final   id   =   int . parse ( request . path . variables [ id ]); \n     final   hero   =   _heroes . firstWhere (( hero )   =   hero [ id ]   ==   id ,   orElse:   ()   =   null ); \n     if   ( hero   ==   null )   { \n       return   Response . notFound (); \n     } \n\n     return   Response . ok ( hero ); \n   } \n\n   return   Response . ok ( _heroes );  }   In your shell currently running the application, hit Ctrl-C to stop the application. Then, run  aqueduct serve  again. In the browser application, click on a hero and you will be taken to a detail page for that hero.   You can verify that your server is responding correctly by executing  curl -X GET http://localhost:8888/heroes/11  to view the single hero object. You can also trigger a 404 Not Found response by getting a hero that doesn't exist.",

Our  handle  method will start to get unmanageable, quickly.  That's where  ResourceController  comes in. A  ResourceController  allows you to create a distinct method for each operation that we can perform on our heroes. One method will handle getting a list of heroes, another will handle getting a single hero, and so on. Each method has an annotation that identifies the HTTP method and path variables the request must have to trigger it.  In  heroes_controller.dart , replace  HeroesController  with the following:  class   HeroesController   extends   ResourceController   { \n   final   _heroes   =   [ \n     { id :   11 ,   name :   Mr. Nice }, \n     { id :   12 ,   name :   Narco }, \n     { id :   13 ,   name :   Bombasto }, \n     { id :   14 ,   name :   Celeritas }, \n     { id :   15 ,   name :   Magneta }, \n   ]; \n\n   @ Operation . get () \n   Future Response   getAllHeroes ()   async   { \n     return   Response . ok ( _heroes ); \n   } \n\n   @ Operation . get ( id ) \n   Future Response   getHeroByID ()   async   { \n     final   id   =   int . parse ( request . path . variables [ id ]); \n     final   hero   =   _heroes . firstWhere (( hero )   =   hero [ id ]   ==   id ,   orElse:   ()   =   null ); \n     if   ( hero   ==   null )   { \n       return   Response . notFound (); \n     } \n\n     return   Response . ok ( hero ); \n   }  }   Notice that we didn't have to override  handle  in  ResourceController . A  ResourceController  implements this method to call one of our  operation methods . An operation method - like  getAllHeroes  and  getHeroByID  - must have an  Operation  annotation. The named constructor  Operation.get  means these methods get called when the request's method is GET. An operation method must also return a  Future Response .  getHeroByID 's annotation also has an argument - the name of our path variable  id . If that path variable exists in the request's path,  getHeroByID  will be called. If it doesn't exist,  getAllHeroes  will be called.   Naming Operation Methods  The plain English phrase for an operation - like 'get hero by id' - is a really good name for an operation method and a good name will be useful when you generate OpenAPI documentation from your code.   Reload the application by hitting Ctrl-C in the terminal that ran  aqueduct serve  and then run  aqueduct serve  again. The browser application should still behave the same.   Browser Clients  In addition to  curl , you can create a SwaggerUI browser application that executes requests against your locally running application. In your project directory, run  aqueduct document client  and it will generate a file named  client.html . Open this file in your browser for a UI that constructs and executes requests that your application supports.",

            "text": "In our  getHeroByID  method, we make a dangerous assumption that the path variable 'id' can be parsed into an integer. If 'id' were something else, like a string,  int.parse  would throw an exception. When exceptions are thrown in operation methods, the controller catches it and sends a 500 Server Error response. 500s are bad, they don't tell the client what's wrong. A 404 Not Found is a better response here, but writing the code to catch that exception and create this response is cumbersome.  Instead, we can rely on a feature of operation methods called  request binding . An operation method can declare parameters and  bind  them to properties of the request. When our operation method gets called, it will be passed values from the request as arguments. Request bindings automatically parse values into the type of the parameter (and return a better error response if parsing fails). Change the method  getHeroByID() :  @ Operation . get ( id )  Future Response   getHeroByID ( @ Bind . path ( id )   int   id )   async   { \n   final   hero   =   _heroes . firstWhere (( hero )   =   hero [ id ]   ==   id ,   orElse:   ()   =   null ); \n\n   if   ( hero   ==   null )   { \n     return   Response . notFound (); \n   } \n\n   return   Response . ok ( hero );  }   The value of the path variable  id  will be parsed as an integer and be available to this method in the  id  parameter. The  @Bind  annotation on an operation method parameter tells Aqueduct the value from the request we want bound. Using the named constructor  Bind.path  binds a path variable, and the name of that variable is indicated in the argument to this constructor.  You can bind path variables, headers, query parameters and bodies. When binding path variables, we have to specify which path variable with the argument to  @Bind.path(pathVariableName) .   Bound Parameter Names  The name of a bound parameter doesn't have to match the name of the path variable. We could have declared it as  @Bind.path('id') int heroID . Only the argument to  Bind 's constructor must match the actual name of the path variable. This is valuable for other types of bindings, like headers, that may contain characters that aren't valid Dart variable names, e.g.  X-API-Key .",

            "text": "In this simple exercise, we used a constant list of heroes as our source of data. For a simple getting-your-feet-wet demo, this is fine. However, in a real application, you'd store this data in a database. That way you could add data to it and not risk losing it when the application was restarted.  More generally, a web server should never hang on to data that can change. While previously just a best practice, stateless web servers are becoming a requirement with the prevalence of containerization and tools like Kubernetes. Aqueduct makes it a bit easier to detect violations of this rule with its multi-threading strategy.  When you run an Aqueduct application, it creates multiple threads. Each of these threads has its own isolated heap in memory; meaning data that exists on one thread can't be accessed from other threads. In Dart, these isolated threads are called  isolates .  An instance of your application channel is created for each isolate. Each HTTP request is given to just one of the isolates to be handled. In a sense, your one application behaves the same as running your application on multiple servers behind a load balancer. (It also makes your application substantially faster.)  If you are storing any data in your application, you'll find out really quick. Why? A request that changes data will only change that data in one of your application's isolates. When you make a request to get that data again, its unlikely that you'll see the changes - another isolate with different data will probably handle that request.",

This will let us to edit our heroes and keep the changes when we restart the application.\n\n\nObject-Relational Mapping\n\n\nA relational database management system (like PostgreSQL or MySQL) stores its data in the form of tables. A table represents some sort of entity - like a person or a bank account. Each table has columns that describe the attributes of that entity - like a name or a balance. Every row in a table is an instance of that entity - like a single person named Bob or a bank account.\n\n\nIn an object-oriented framework like Aqueduct, we have representations for tables, columns and rows. A class represents a table, its instances are rows, and instance properties are column values. An ORM translates rows in a database to and from objects in an application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAqueduct\n\n\nDatabase\n\n\nExample #1\n\n\nExample #2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass\n\n\nTable\n\n\nPerson\n\n\nBank Account\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstance\n\n\nRow\n\n\nA person named Bob\n\n\nSally's Bank Account\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty\n\n\nColumn\n\n\nPerson's Name\n\n\nBank Account Balance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Aqueduct, each database table-class pairing is called an \nentity\n. Collectively, an application's entities are called its \ndata model\n.\n\n\nBuilding a Data Model\n\n\nIn our \nheroes\n application, we will have one type of entity - a \"hero\". To create a new entity, we subclass \nManagedObject\nT\n. Create a new directory \nlib/model/\n and then add a new file to this directory named \nhero.dart\n. Add the following code:\n\n\nimport\n \npackage:heroes/heroes.dart\n;\n\n\n\nclass\n \nHero\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_Hero\n \nimplements\n \n_Hero\n \n{}\n\n\n\nclass\n \n_Hero\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nprimaryKey\n\n  \nint\n \nid\n;\n\n\n  \n@\nColumn\n(\nunique:\n \ntrue\n)\n\n  \nString\n \nname\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis declares a \nHero\n entity. Entities are always made up of two classes.\n\n\nThe \n_Hero\n class is a direct mapping of a database table. This table's name will have the same name as the class: \n_Hero\n. Every property declared in this class will have a corresponding column in this table. Therefore, the \n_Hero\n table will have two columns - \nid\n and \nname\n. The \nid\n column is this table's primary key (a unique identifier for each hero). The name of each hero must be unique.\n\n\nThe other class, \nHero\n, is what we work with in our code - when we fetch heroes from a database, they will be instances of \nHero\n.\n\n\nThe \nHero\n class is called the \ninstance type\n of the entity, because that's what we have instances of. \n_Hero\n is the \ntable definition\n of the entity. You won't use the table definition for anything other than describing the database table.\n\n\nAn instance type must \nimplement\n its table definition; this gives our \nHero\n all of the properties of \n_Hero\n. An instance type must \nextend\n \nManagedObject\nT\n, where \nT\n is also the table definition. \nManagedObject\nT\n has behavior for automatically transferring objects to the database and back (among other things).\n\n\n\n\nTransient Properties\n\n\nProperties declared in the instance type aren't stored in the database. This is different than properties in the table definition. For example, a database table might have a \nfirstName\n and \nlastName\n, but it's useful in some places to have a \nfullName\n property. Declaring the \nfullName\n property in the instance type means we have easy access to the full name, but we still store the first and last name individually.\n\n\n\n\nDefining a Context\n\n\nOur application needs to know two things to execute database queries:\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the data model (our collection of entities)?\n\n\nWhat database are we connecting to?\n\n\n\n\nBoth of these things are set up when an application is first started. In \nchannel.dart\n, add a new property \ncontext\n and update \nprepare()\n:\n\n\nclass\n \nHeroesChannel\n \nextends\n \nApplicationChannel\n \n{\n\n  \nManagedContext\n \ncontext\n;\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nFuture\n \nprepare\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nlogger\n.\nonRecord\n.\nlisten\n((\nrec\n)\n \n=\n \nprint\n(\n$\nrec\n \n${\nrec\n.\nerror\n \n??\n \n}\n \n${\nrec\n.\nstackTrace\n \n??\n \n}\n));\n\n\n    \nfinal\n \ndataModel\n \n=\n \nManagedDataModel\n.\nfromCurrentMirrorSystem\n();\n\n    \nfinal\n \npersistentStore\n \n=\n \nPostgreSQLPersistentStore\n.\nfromConnectionInfo\n(\n\n      \nheroes_user\n,\n \npassword\n,\n \nlocalhost\n,\n \n5432\n,\n \nheroes\n);\n\n\n    \ncontext\n \n=\n \nManagedContext\n(\ndataModel\n,\n \npersistentStore\n);\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nController\n \nget\n \nentryPoint\n \n{\n\n    \n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManagedDataModel.fromCurrentMirrorSystem()\n will find all of our \nManagedObject\nT\n subclasses and 'compile' them into a data model. A \nPostgreSQLPersistentStore\n takes database connection information that it will use to connect and send queries to a database. Together, these objects are packaged in a \nManagedContext\n.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring a Database Connection\n\n\nThis tutorial hardcodes the information needed to connect to a database. In a future chapter, we will move these values to a configuration file so that we can change them during tests and various deployment environments.\n\n\n\n\nThe context will coordinate with these two objects to execute queries and translate objects to and from the database. Controllers that make database queries need a reference to the context. So, we'll want \nHeroesController\n to have access to the context.\n\n\nIn \nheroes_controller.dart\n, add a property and create a new constructor:\n\n\nclass\n \nHeroesController\n \nextends\n \nResourceController\n \n{\n\n  \nHeroesController\n(\nthis\n.\ncontext\n);\n\n\n  \nfinal\n \nManagedContext\n \ncontext\n;\n  \n  \n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that \nHeroesController\n requires a context in its constructor, we need to pass it the context we created in \nprepare()\n. Update \nentryPoint\n in \nchannel.dart\n.\n\n\n@\noverride\n\n\nController\n \nget\n \nentryPoint\n \n{\n\n  \nfinal\n \nrouter\n \n=\n \nRouter\n();\n\n\n  \nrouter\n\n    \n.\nroute\n(\n/heroes/[:id]\n)\n\n    \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nHeroesController\n(\ncontext\n));\n\n\n  \nrouter\n\n    \n.\nroute\n(\n/example\n)\n\n    \n.\nlinkFunction\n((\nrequest\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n      \nreturn\n \nnew\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n({\nkey\n:\n \nvalue\n});\n\n  \n});\n\n\n  \nreturn\n \nrouter\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we've 'injected' this context into our \nHeroesController\n constructor, each \nHeroesController\n can execute database queries.\n\n\n\n\nService Objects and Dependency Injection\n\n\nOur context is an example of a \nservice object\n. A service encapsulates logic and state into a single object that can be reused in multiple controllers. A typical service object accesses another server, like a database or another REST API. Some service objects may simply provide a simplified interface to a complex process, like applying transforms to an image. Services are passed in a controller's constructor;\nthis is called \ndependency injection\n. Unlike many frameworks, Aqueduct does not require a complex dependency injection framework; this is because you write the code to create instances of your controllers and can pass whatever you like in their constructor.\n\n\n\n\nExecuting Queries\n\n\nOur operation methods in \nHeroesController\n currently return heroes from an in-memory list. To fetch data from a database instead of this list, we create and execute instances of \nQuery\nT\n in our \nManagedContext\n.\n\n\nLet's start by replacing \ngetAllHeroes\n in \nheroes_controller.dart\n. Make sure to import your \nmodel/hero.dart\n file at the top:\n\n\nimport\n \npackage:heroes/heroes.dart\n;\n\n\nimport\n \npackage:heroes/model/hero.dart\n;\n\n\n\nclass\n \nHeroesController\n \nextends\n \nResourceController\n \n{\n\n  \nHeroesController\n(\nthis\n.\ncontext\n);\n\n\n  \nfinal\n \nManagedContext\n \ncontext\n;\n\n\n  \n@\nOperation\n.\nget\n()\n\n  \nFuture\nResponse\n \ngetAllHeroes\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nfinal\n \nheroQuery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nHero\n(\ncontext\n);\n\n    \nfinal\n \nheroes\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nheroQuery\n.\nfetch\n();\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\nheroes\n);\n\n  \n}\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we create an instance of \nQuery\nHero\n and then execute its \nfetch()\n method. The type argument to \nQuery\nT\n is an instance type; it lets the query know which table to fetch rows from and the type of objects that are returned by the query. The context argument tells it which database to fetch it from. The \nfetch()\n execution method returns a \nList\nHero\n. We write that list to the body of the response.\n\n\nNow, let's update \ngetHeroByID\n to fetch a single hero from the database.\n\n\n@\nOperation\n.\nget\n(\nid\n)\n\n\nFuture\nResponse\n \ngetHeroByID\n(\n@\nBind\n.\npath\n(\nid\n)\n \nint\n \nid\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n  \nfinal\n \nheroQuery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nHero\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n    \n..\nwhere\n((\nh\n)\n \n=\n \nh\n.\nid\n).\nequalTo\n(\nid\n);\n    \n\n  \nfinal\n \nhero\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nheroQuery\n.\nfetchOne\n();\n\n\n  \nif\n \n(\nhero\n \n==\n \nnull\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \nResponse\n.\nnotFound\n();\n\n  \n}\n\n  \nreturn\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\nhero\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis query does two interesting things. First, it uses the \nwhere\n method to filter heroes that have the same \nid\n as the path variable. For example, \n/heroes/1\n will fetch a hero with an \nid\n of \n1\n. This works because \nQuery.where\n adds a SQL WHERE clause to the query. We'd get the following SQL:\n\n\nSELECT\n \nid\n,\n \nname\n \nFROM\n \n_question\n \nWHERE\n \nid\n \n=\n \n1\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nwhere\n method uses the \nproperty selector\n syntax. This syntax is a closure that takes an argument of the type being queried, and must return a property of that object. This creates an expression object that targets the selected property. By invoking methods like \nequalTo\n on this expression object, a boolean expression is added to the query.\n\n\n\n\nProperty Selectors\n\n\nMany query configuration methods use the property selector syntax. Setting up a keyboard shortcut (called a Live Template in IntelliJ) to enter the syntax is beneficial. A downloadable settings configuration for IntelliJ exists \nhere\n that includes this shortcut.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nfetchOne()\n execution method will fetch a single object that fulfills all of the expressions applied to the query. If no database row meets the criteria, \nnull\n is returned. Our controller returns a 404 Not Found response in that scenario.\n\n\nWe have now written code that fetches heroes from a database instead of from in memory, but we don't have a database - yet.\n\n\n\n\nfetchObjectWithID, fetchOne() and Unique Properties\n\n\nYou can also fetch an object by its primary key with the method \nManagedContext.fetchObjectWithID\n. When fetching with \nfetchOne\n, make sure the search criteria is guaranteed to be unique.\n\n\n\n\nSetting Up a Database\n\n\nFor development, you'll need to install a PostgreSQL server on your local machine. If you are on macOS, use \nPostgres.app\n. This native macOS application manages starting and stopping PostgreSQL servers on your machine. For other platforms, see \nthis page\n.\n\n\n\n\n9.6 or Greater\n\n\nThe minimum version of PostgreSQL needed to work with Aqueduct is 9.6.\n\n\n\n\nIf you installed Postgres.app, open the application and select the \n+\n button on the bottom left corner of the screen to create a new database server. Choose a version (at least 9.6, but the most recent version is best), name the server whatever you like, and leave the rest of the options unchanged before clicking \nCreate Server\n. Once the server has been created, click \nStart\n.\n\n\nA list of databases available on this server will be shown as named, database icons. Double-click on any of them to open the \npsql\n command-line tool.\n\n\n\n\npsql\n\n\nFor other platforms, \npsql\n should be available in your \n$PATH\n. You can also add \nPostgres.app\n's \npsql\n to your path with the directions \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nIn \npsql\n, create a new database and a user to manage it.\n\n\nCREATE\n \nDATABASE\n \nheroes\n;\n\n\nCREATE\n \nUSER\n \nheroes_user\n \nWITH\n \ncreatedb\n;\n\n\nALTER\n \nUSER\n \nheroes_user\n \nWITH\n \npassword\n \npassword\n;\n\n\nGRANT\n \nall\n \nON\n \ndatabase\n \nheroes\n \nTO\n \nheroes_user\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we need to create the table where heroes are stored in this database. From your project directory, run the following command:\n\n\naqueduct db generate\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command will create a new \nmigration file\n. A migration file is a Dart script that runs a series of SQL commands to alter a database's schema. It is created in a new directory in your project named \nmigrations/\n. Open \nmigrations/00000001_initial.migration.dart\n, it should look like this:\n\n\nimport\n \npackage:aqueduct/aqueduct.dart\n;\n\n\nimport\n \ndart:async\n;\n\n\n\nclass\n \nMigration1\n \nextends\n \nMigration\n \n{\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nFuture\n \nupgrade\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \ndatabase\n.\ncreateTable\n(\nSchemaTable\n(\n\n      \n_Hero\n,\n \n[\n\n        \nSchemaColumn\n(\nid\n,\n \nManagedPropertyType\n.\nbigInteger\n,\n\n            \nisPrimaryKey:\n \ntrue\n,\n \nautoincrement:\n \ntrue\n,\n \nisIndexed:\n \nfalse\n,\n \nisNullable:\n \nfalse\n,\n \nisUnique:\n \nfalse\n),\n\n        \nSchemaColumn\n(\nname\n,\n \nManagedPropertyType\n.\nstring\n,\n\n            \nisPrimaryKey:\n \nfalse\n,\n \nautoincrement:\n \nfalse\n,\n \nisIndexed:\n \nfalse\n,\n \nisNullable:\n \nfalse\n,\n \nisUnique:\n \ntrue\n),\n\n      \n],\n\n    \n));\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nFuture\n \ndowngrade\n()\n \nasync\n \n{}\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nFuture\n \nseed\n()\n \nasync\n \n{}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a moment, we'll execute this migration file. That will create a new table named \n_Hero\n with columns for \nid\n and \nname\n. Before we run it, we should seed the database with some initial heroes. In the \nseed()\n method, add the following:\n\n\n@\noverride\n\n\nFuture\n \nseed\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n  \nfinal\n \nheroNames\n \n=\n \n[\nMr. Nice\n,\n \nNarco\n,\n \nBombasto\n,\n \nCeleritas\n,\n \nMagneta\n];\n\n\n  \nfor\n \n(\nfinal\n \nheroName\n \nin\n \nheroNames\n)\n \n{\n    \n    \nawait\n \ndatabase\n.\nstore\n.\nexecute\n(\nINSERT INTO _Hero (name) VALUES (@name)\n,\n \nsubstitutionValues:\n \n{\n\n      \nname\n:\n \nheroName\n\n    \n});\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply this migration file to our locally running \nheroes\n database with the following command in the project directory:\n\n\naqueduct\n \ndb\n \nupgrade\n \n--\nconnect\n \npostgres:\n//heroes_user:password@localhost:5432/heroes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRe-run your application with \naqueduct serve\n. Then, reload \nhttp://aqueduct-tutorial.stablekernel.io\n. Your dashboard of heroes and detail page for each will still show up - but this time, they are sourced from a database.\n\n\n\n\nManagedObjects and Migration Scripts\n\n\nIn our migration's \nseed()\n method, we executed SQL queries instead of using the Aqueduct ORM. \nIt is very important that you do not use\n \nQuery\nT\n, \nManagedObject\nT\n or other elements of the Aqueduct ORM in migration files. Migration files represent an ordered series of historical steps that describe your database schema. If you replay those steps (which is what executing a migration file does), you will end up with the same database schema every time. However, a \nManagedObject\nT\n subclass changes over time - the definition of a managed object is not historical, it only represents the current point in time. Since a \nManagedObject\nT\n subclass can change, using one in our migration file would mean that our migration file could change.\n\n\n\n\nQuery Parameters and HTTP Headers\n\n\nIn the browser application, the dashboard has a text field for searching heroes. When you enter text into it, it will send the search term to the server by appending a query parameter to \nGET /heroes\n. For example, if you entered the text \nabc\n, it'd make this request:\n\n\nGET /heroes?name=abc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Aqueduct application can use this value to return a list of heroes that contains the search string. In \nheroes_controller.dart\n, modify \ngetAllHeroes()\n to bind the 'name' query parameter:\n\n\n@\nOperation\n.\nget\n()\n\n\nFuture\nResponse\n \ngetAllHeroes\n({\n@\nBind\n.\nquery\n(\nname\n)\n \nString\n \nname\n})\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n  \nfinal\n \nheroQuery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nHero\n(\ncontext\n);\n\n  \nif\n \n(\nname\n \n!=\n \nnull\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nheroQuery\n.\nwhere\n((\nh\n)\n \n=\n \nh\n.\nname\n).\ncontains\n(\nname\n,\n \ncaseSensitive:\n \nfalse\n);\n\n  \n}\n\n  \nfinal\n \nheroes\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nheroQuery\n.\nfetch\n();\n\n\n  \nreturn\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\nheroes\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can re-run your Aqueduct application and use the search bar in the client application.\n\n\nThe \n@Bind.query('name')\n annotation will bind the value of the 'name' query parameter if it is included in the request URL. Otherwise, \nname\n will be null.\n\n\nNotice that \nname\n is an \noptional parameter\n (it is surrounded by curly brackets). An optional parameter in an operation method is also optional in the HTTP request. If we removed the curly brackets from this binding, the 'name' query parameter would become required and the request \nGET /heroes\n without \n?name=x\n would fail with a 400 Bad Request.\n\n\n\n\nResourceController Binding\n\n\nThere is even more to bindings than we've shown (like automatically parsing bound values into types like \nint\n and \nDateTime\n). For more information, see \nResourceControllers\n.\n\n\n\n\nBinding query and header parameters in a operation method is a good way to make your code more intentional and avoid boilerplate parsing code. Aqueduct is able to generate better documentation when using bindings.\n\n\nNext: Storing Data",

Create a new directory  lib/model/  and then add a new file to this directory named  hero.dart . Add the following code:  import   package:heroes/heroes.dart ;  class   Hero   extends   ManagedObject _Hero   implements   _Hero   {}  class   _Hero   { \n   @ primaryKey \n   int   id ; \n\n   @ Column ( unique:   true ) \n   String   name ;  }   This declares a  Hero  entity. Entities are always made up of two classes.  The  _Hero  class is a direct mapping of a database table. This table's name will have the same name as the class:  _Hero . Every property declared in this class will have a corresponding column in this table. Therefore, the  _Hero  table will have two columns -  id  and  name . The  id  column is this table's primary key (a unique identifier for each hero). The name of each hero must be unique.  The other class,  Hero , is what we work with in our code - when we fetch heroes from a database, they will be instances of  Hero .  The  Hero  class is called the  instance type  of the entity, because that's what we have instances of.  _Hero  is the  table definition  of the entity. You won't use the table definition for anything other than describing the database table.  An instance type must  implement  its table definition; this gives our  Hero  all of the properties of  _Hero . An instance type must  extend   ManagedObject T , where  T  is also the table definition.  ManagedObject T  has behavior for automatically transferring objects to the database and back (among other things).   Transient Properties  Properties declared in the instance type aren't stored in the database. This is different than properties in the table definition. For example, a database table might have a  firstName  and  lastName , but it's useful in some places to have a  fullName  property. Declaring the  fullName  property in the instance type means we have easy access to the full name, but we still store the first and last name individually.",

Both of these things are set up when an application is first started.

ManagedDataModel.fromCurrentMirrorSystem()  will find all of our  ManagedObject T  subclasses and 'compile' them into a data model. A  PostgreSQLPersistentStore  takes database connection information that it will use to connect and send queries to a database. Together, these objects are packaged in a  ManagedContext .   Configuring a Database Connection  This tutorial hardcodes the information needed to connect to a database. In a future chapter, we will move these values to a configuration file so that we can change them during tests and various deployment environments.   The context will coordinate with these two objects to execute queries and translate objects to and from the database. Controllers that make database queries need a reference to the context. So, we'll want  HeroesController  to have access to the context.  In  heroes_controller.dart , add a property and create a new constructor:  class   HeroesController   extends   ResourceController   { \n   HeroesController ( this . context ); \n\n   final   ManagedContext   context ;   \n   ...   Now that  HeroesController  requires a context in its constructor, we need to pass it the context we created in  prepare() . Update  entryPoint  in  channel.dart .  @ override  Controller   get   entryPoint   { \n   final   router   =   Router (); \n\n   router \n     . route ( /heroes/[:id] ) \n     . link (()   =   HeroesController ( context )); \n\n   router \n     . route ( /example ) \n     . linkFunction (( request )   async   { \n       return   new   Response . ok ({ key :   value }); \n   }); \n\n   return   router ;  }   Now that we've 'injected' this context into our  HeroesController  constructor, each  HeroesController  can execute database queries.   Service Objects and Dependency Injection  Our context is an example of a  service object . A service encapsulates logic and state into a single object that can be reused in multiple controllers. A typical service object accesses another server, like a database or another REST API. Some service objects may simply provide a simplified interface to a complex process, like applying transforms to an image. Services are passed in a controller's constructor;\nthis is called  dependency injection . Unlike many frameworks, Aqueduct does not require a complex dependency injection framework; this is because you write the code to create instances of your controllers and can pass whatever you like in their constructor.",

To fetch data from a database instead of this list, we create and execute instances of  Query T  in our  ManagedContext .  Let's start by replacing  getAllHeroes  in  heroes_controller.dart . Make sure to import your  model/hero.dart  file at the top:  import   package:heroes/heroes.dart ;  import   package:heroes/model/hero.dart ;  class   HeroesController   extends   ResourceController   { \n   HeroesController ( this . context ); \n\n   final   ManagedContext   context ; \n\n   @ Operation . get () \n   Future Response   getAllHeroes ()   async   { \n     final   heroQuery   =   Query Hero ( context ); \n     final   heroes   =   await   heroQuery . fetch (); \n\n     return   Response . ok ( heroes ); \n   }  ...   Here, we create an instance of  Query Hero  and then execute its  fetch()  method. The type argument to  Query T  is an instance type; it lets the query know which table to fetch rows from and the type of objects that are returned by the query. The context argument tells it which database to fetch it from. The  fetch()  execution method returns a  List Hero . We write that list to the body of the response.  Now, let's update  getHeroByID  to fetch a single hero from the database.  @ Operation . get ( id )  Future Response   getHeroByID ( @ Bind . path ( id )   int   id )   async   { \n   final   heroQuery   =   Query Hero ( context ) \n     .. where (( h )   =   h . id ). equalTo ( id );     \n\n   final   hero   =   await   heroQuery . fetchOne (); \n\n   if   ( hero   ==   null )   { \n     return   Response . notFound (); \n   } \n   return   Response . ok ( hero );  }   This query does two interesting things. First, it uses the  where  method to filter heroes that have the same  id  as the path variable. For example,  /heroes/1  will fetch a hero with an  id  of  1 . This works because  Query.where  adds a SQL WHERE clause to the query. We'd get the following SQL:  SELECT   id ,   name   FROM   _question   WHERE   id   =   1 ;   The  where  method uses the  property selector  syntax. This syntax is a closure that takes an argument of the type being queried, and must return a property of that object. This creates an expression object that targets the selected property. By invoking methods like  equalTo  on this expression object, a boolean expression is added to the query.   Property Selectors  Many query configuration methods use the property selector syntax. Setting up a keyboard shortcut (called a Live Template in IntelliJ) to enter the syntax is beneficial. A downloadable settings configuration for IntelliJ exists  here  that includes this shortcut.   The  fetchOne()  execution method will fetch a single object that fulfills all of the expressions applied to the query. If no database row meets the criteria,  null  is returned. Our controller returns a 404 Not Found response in that scenario.  We have now written code that fetches heroes from a database instead of from in memory, but we don't have a database - yet.   fetchObjectWithID, fetchOne() and Unique Properties  You can also fetch an object by its primary key with the method  ManagedContext.fetchObjectWithID .

Now, we will allow our application to store, delete and modify heroes in the database. Before we embark on this part of the journey, it's important that we understand how an HTTP API is intended to work.\n\n\nHTTP Resources and Methods\n\n\nThe \nHTTP specification\n defines the concept of a \nresource\n. A resource can be anything - a hero, a bank account, a light switch in your home, a temperature sensor in Antarctica, etc. Some of these things are physical objects (the light switch), and some are digital - and they are all resources. An HTTP server application is an interface to these resources; a client requests that something be done with a resource, and the server finds a way to get it done.\n\n\nResources are identified with a URI. A URI \nuniversally identifies\n a resource: it has the address of a server to connect to, and a path that identifies the resource on that server. When writing Aqueduct applications, we don't care much about the server part of a URL - the internet figures out that part. What we do care about is the path of the URL - like \n/heroes\n.\n\n\nAn application uses the URL path to determine which resource the request wants to work with. Right now, our application works with hero resources. A request with the path \n/heroes/1\n wants to do something with an individual hero (that is identified by the number \n1\n). A request with the path \n/heroes\n will act on the entire collection of heroes.\n\n\nThese actions are primarily described by the request method (like GET, POST, OR DELETE). Each of these methods has a general meaning that describes an action that can be applied to a resource. For example, a \nGET /heroes\n means \"get me all of the hero resources\". The meaning for each of these methods are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nGET: returns a collection of some resource or an individual resource\n\n\nPOST: inserts or appends a resource to a collection of some resource; a representation of the resource is in the request body\n\n\nPUT: replaces a resource with the contents of the request body (or in some cases, replaces the entire collection of some resource)\n\n\nDELETE: deletes a resource (or in some cases, deletes the entire collection of some resource)\n\n\n\n\nIt turns out, we can create a lot of incredible behavior by just combining these methods and a request path. More importantly, by following these specifications, client applications can use generic libraries to access any HTTP API with very little effort. This allows us to create complex systems that are easily made available to a browser, mobile phone or any other internet-connected device.\n\n\nInserting Data\n\n\nWe'll start by adding behavior that allows for new heroes to be inserted into the database. Following our previous discussion, the HTTP request must take the form \nPOST /heroes\n - we are appending a new hero to the collection of heroes. This request will contain the JSON representation of a hero in its body, for example:\n\n\n{\n\n  \nname\n:\n \nMaster of Aqueducts\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur \nHeroesController\n will handle this operation. In general, a single endpoint controller should handle every operation on a resource collection and its individual resources. In \nheroes_controller.dart\n, add the following operation method:\n\n\n@\nOperation\n.\npost\n()\n\n\nFuture\nResponse\n \ncreateHero\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n  \nfinal\n \nMap\nString\n,\n \ndynamic\n \nbody\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nrequest\n.\nbody\n.\ndecode\n();\n\n  \nfinal\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nHero\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n    \n..\nvalues\n.\nname\n \n=\n \nbody\n[\nname\n]\n \nas\n \nString\n;\n\n\n  \nfinal\n \ninsertedHero\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nquery\n.\ninsert\n();\n\n\n  \nreturn\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\ninsertedHero\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis operation method decodes the hero from the request's body, constructs a query that inserts that hero, and then returns it in the response.\n\n\nUsing a \nQuery\nHero\n to insert a row isn't very different than using one to fetch rows. When inserting a row, we execute \nquery.insert()\n instead of \nquery.fetch()\n. Instead of applying expressions with \nwhere\n, we set the properties of \nvalues\n. The \nvalues\n of a query is an empty instance of the type being inserted.\n\n\nEach property we set on \nvalues\n is sent in an \nINSERT\n command to the database. The generated SQL for the above would be something like:\n\n\nINSERT\n \nINTO\n \n_Hero\n \n(\nname\n)\n \nVALUES\n \n(\nHero Name\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe database automatically generates a value for the \nid\n property of a \nHero\n (its \n@primaryKey\n annotation enables the \"auto-incrementing\" option). When the row has been successfully inserted, a new \nHero\n object is returned - containing any values that were generated by the database. Most API endpoints return the created object in the response so that the client has the same information that the server has, and our application is no different.\n\n\n\n\nColumn Attributes\n\n\nSee \nthe API reference for Column\n for column options like auto-incrementing.\n\n\n\n\nRe-run your application. In the browser application, click on \nHeroes\n near the top of the page. Then, enter a name into the \nHero name:\n field and click \nAdd\n. The new hero will appear. You can re-run the application and that hero will still be available, because it has been stored in the database on your machine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSub-resources\n\n\nWe mentioned that a single controller should handle every operation for a resource collection and its individual resources. Some resources are complex enough that they can have sub-resources. For example, an organization of heroes (like the X-Men or Fantastic Four) contains heroes, but it might also contain buildings and equipment owned by the organization. The heroes, buildings and equipment are sub-resources of an organization.  Each sub-resource should have its own route and controller instead of trying to shove everything into a single route and controller. See the following code snippet for an example.\n\n\n\n\n@\noverride\n\n\nController\n \nget\n \nentryPoint\n \n{\n\n  \nreturn\n \nRouter\n()\n\n    \n..\nroute\n(\n/organizations/[:orgName]\n)\n\n      \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nOrganizationController\n());\n\n    \n..\nroute\n(\n/organizations/:orgName/heroes/[:heroID]\n)\n\n      \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nOrgHeroesController\n());\n\n    \n..\nroute\n(\n/organizations/:orgName/buildings/[:buildingID]\n)\n\n      \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nOrgBuildingController\n());\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest and Response Bodies\n\n\nSo far, we've largely glossed over how request and response bodies are handled, and now is a good time to dig in to this topic.\n\n\nResponse Body Encoding\n\n\nWhen we create a response, we specify its status code and optionally its headers and body. For example, the following creates a response with a status code of 200 OK with an empty list body:\n\n\nResponse\n.\nok\n([])\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first argument to \nResponse.ok\n is a \nbody object\n. A body object is automatically encoded according to the \ncontentType\n of its response. By default, the content type of a response is \napplication/json\n - so by default, all of our response body objects are JSON-encoded in the response body.\n\n\n\n\nOther Response Constructors\n\n\nThe default constructor for a \nResponse\n takes a status code, map of headers and a body object: \nResponse(200, {}, \"body\")\n. There are many named constructors for \nResponse\n, like \nResponse.ok\n or \nResponse.notFound\n. These constructors set the status code and expose parameters that are intended for that type of response. For example, a 200 OK response should have a body, so \nResponse.ok\n has a required body object argument. See \nthe API reference for Response\n for possible constructors and properties of a response.\n\n\n\n\nTo change the format a body object is encoded into, you set the \ncontentType\n of the response. For example,\n\n\nResponse\n.\nok\n([])\n\n  \n..\ncontentType\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nContentType\n(\napplication\n,\n \nxml\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default supported content types are JSON, \napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded\n and all \ntext/*\n types. To encode other content-types, you must register a \nCodec\n with \nCodecRegistry.\n A body object is only valid if the codec selected by the response's content-type can encode it. If it can't, an error will be thrown and a 500 Server Error response is sent instead.\n\n\nTypes that implement \nSerializable\n may also be body objects. Objects that implement this type provide an \nasMap()\n method that converts their properties into a \nMap\n before being passed to the encoder. This \nMap\n must be encodable for the response's content-type codec. You may also provide a \nList\n of \nSerializable\n, for which the list of each object's \nasMap()\n is passed to the encoder.\n\n\nManagedObject\n implements the \nSerializable\n interface, and therefore all managed objects (and lists of managed objects) can be body objects.\n\n\nRequest Body Decoding\n\n\nEvery \nRequest\n has a \nbody\n property of type \nRequestBody\n. A \nRequestBody\n decodes the contents of the request body into Dart objects that you use in your application. This decoding is performed by the \nCodec\n that is associated with the request's content-type. The decoded object is determined by the format of the data - for example, a JSON array decodes into a \nList\n, a JSON object into a \nMap\n.\n\n\nWhen you write code to decode a request body, you are also validating the request body is in the expected format. For example, your \nHeroesController\n invokes \ndecode\n like this:\n\n\nMap\nString\n,\n \ndynamic\n \nbody\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nrequest\n.\nbody\n.\ndecode\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \ndecode\n method has a type argument that is inferred to be a \nMap\nString, dynamic\n. If the decoded body is not a \nMap\n, an exception is thrown that sends an appropriate error response to the client.\n\n\nYou may also bind the body of a request to an operation method parameter. Let's bind a \nHero\n instance to a request body in our \nHeroesController\n. Update the code in that file to the following:\n\n\n@\nOperation\n.\npost\n()\n\n\nFuture\nResponse\n \ncreateHero\n(\n@\nBind\n.\nbody\n()\n \nHero\n \ninputHero\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n  \nfinal\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nHero\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n    \n..\nvalues\n \n=\n \ninputHero\n;\n\n\n  \nfinal\n \ninsertedHero\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nquery\n.\ninsert\n();\n\n\n  \nreturn\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\ninsertedHero\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValues in the request body object are decoded into a \nHero\n object - each key in the request body maps to a property of our \nHero\n. For example, the value for the key 'name' is stored in the \ninputHero.name\n. If decoding the request body into a \nHero\n instance fails for any reason, a 400 Bad Request response is sent and the operation method is not called.\n\n\nAn object can only be bound to a request body if it implements \nSerializable\n - the good news is all \nManagedObject\ns implement this interface. You may create your own types that implement this interface, and you may also bind a \nList\nT\n, where \nT\n implements the interface.\n\n\nRe-run your \nheroes\n application. On \nhttp://aqueduct-tutorial.stablekernel.io\n, click on the \nHeroes\n button on the top of the screen. In the text field, enter a new hero name and click \nAdd\n. You'll see your new hero added to the list! You can shutdown your application and run it again and you'll still be able to fetch your new hero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuery Construction\n\n\nProperties like \nvalues\n and \nwhere\n prevent errors by type and name checking columns with the analyzer. They're also great for speeding up writing code because your IDE will autocomplete property names. There is \nspecific behavior\n a query uses to decide whether it should include a value from these two properties in the SQL it generates.\n\n\n\n\nNext Chapter: Writing Tests",

A resource can be anything - a hero, a bank account, a light switch in your home, a temperature sensor in Antarctica, etc. Some of these things are physical objects (the light switch), and some are digital - and they are all resources. An HTTP server application is an interface to these resources; a client requests that something be done with a resource, and the server finds a way to get it done.  Resources are identified with a URI. A URI  universally identifies  a resource: it has the address of a server to connect to, and a path that identifies the resource on that server. When writing Aqueduct applications, we don't care much about the server part of a URL - the internet figures out that part. What we do care about is the path of the URL - like  /heroes .  An application uses the URL path to determine which resource the request wants to work with. Right now, our application works with hero resources. A request with the path  /heroes/1  wants to do something with an individual hero (that is identified by the number  1 ). A request with the path  /heroes  will act on the entire collection of heroes.  These actions are primarily described by the request method (like GET, POST, OR DELETE). Each of these methods has a general meaning that describes an action that can be applied to a resource. For example, a  GET /heroes  means \"get me all of the hero resources\". The meaning for each of these methods are as follows:   GET: returns a collection of some resource or an individual resource  POST: inserts or appends a resource to a collection of some resource; a representation of the resource is in the request body  PUT: replaces a resource with the contents of the request body (or in some cases, replaces the entire collection of some resource)  DELETE: deletes a resource (or in some cases, deletes the entire collection of some resource)   It turns out, we can create a lot of incredible behavior by just combining these methods and a request path. More importantly, by following these specifications, client applications can use generic libraries to access any HTTP API with very little effort. This allows us to create complex systems that are easily made available to a browser, mobile phone or any other internet-connected device.",

This request will contain the JSON representation of a hero in its body, for example:  { \n   name :   Master of Aqueducts  }   Our  HeroesController  will handle this operation. In general, a single endpoint controller should handle every operation on a resource collection and its individual resources. In  heroes_controller.dart , add the following operation method:  @ Operation . post ()  Future Response   createHero ()   async   { \n   final   Map String ,   dynamic   body   =   await   request . body . decode (); \n   final   query   =   Query Hero ( context ) \n     .. values . name   =   body [ name ]   as   String ; \n\n   final   insertedHero   =   await   query . insert (); \n\n   return   Response . ok ( insertedHero );  }   This operation method decodes the hero from the request's body, constructs a query that inserts that hero, and then returns it in the response.

We will also set up configurable environments for our application.\n\n\nApplication Configuration\n\n\nRight now, our application hardcodes its database connection information. This is bad because we want to use a different database when we're testing, running locally and running in production. It's also bad because we'd have to check our database password into version control.\n\n\nWe can create an configuration file to store values like database connection information, and use a different configuration file for each environment. The \nheroes\n application needs to be able to configure the username, password, host port and name of the database it uses. Open the file \nconfig.yaml\n, which is empty, and enter the following key-value pairs:\n\n\ndatabase\n:\n\n  \nhost\n:\n \nlocalhost\n\n  \nport\n:\n \n5432\n\n  \nusername\n:\n \nheroes_user\n\n  \npassword\n:\n \npassword\n\n  \ndatabaseName\n:\n \nheroes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are the same values we used in our application channel. We'll want to replace the hardcoded values with whatever values are in this file. In \nlib/channel.dart\n, declare a new class at the bottom of the file:\n\n\nclass\n \nHeroConfig\n \nextends\n \nConfiguration\n \n{\n\n  \nHeroConfig\n(\nString\n \npath\n)\n:\n \nsuper\n.\nfromFile\n(\nFile\n(\npath\n));\n\n\n  \nDatabaseConfiguration\n \ndatabase\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA \nConfiguration\n subclass declares the expected properties of a configuration file. \nHeroConfig\n has one property named \ndatabase\n - this matches the name of our top-level key in \nconfig.yaml\n. A \nDatabaseConfiguration\n is a built-in configuration type that has properties for \nhost\n, \nport\n, \nusername\n, \npassword\n and \ndatabaseName\n. We can load \nconfig.yaml\n into a \nHeroConfig\n because they have the same structure and all of the key names match the property names in our configuration types.\n\n\n\n\nInvalid Configuration\n\n\nIf your configuration file and configuration object don't have a matching structure, an error will be thrown when your application starts and tell you which values are missing.\n\n\n\n\nLet's load \nconfig.yaml\n and use its values to set up our database connection by replacing the \nprepare\n method in \nlib/channel.dart\n:\n\n\n@\noverride\n\n\nFuture\n \nprepare\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n  \nlogger\n.\nonRecord\n.\nlisten\n(\n\n      \n(\nrec\n)\n \n=\n \nprint\n(\n$\nrec\n \n${\nrec\n.\nerror\n \n??\n \n}\n \n${\nrec\n.\nstackTrace\n \n??\n \n}\n));\n\n\n  \nfinal\n \nconfig\n \n=\n \nHeroConfig\n(\noptions\n.\nconfigurationFilePath\n);\n\n  \nfinal\n \ndataModel\n \n=\n \nManagedDataModel\n.\nfromCurrentMirrorSystem\n();\n\n  \nfinal\n \npersistentStore\n \n=\n \nPostgreSQLPersistentStore\n.\nfromConnectionInfo\n(\n\n      \nconfig\n.\ndatabase\n.\nusername\n,\n\n      \nconfig\n.\ndatabase\n.\npassword\n,\n\n      \nconfig\n.\ndatabase\n.\nhost\n,\n\n      \nconfig\n.\ndatabase\n.\nport\n,\n\n      \nconfig\n.\ndatabase\n.\ndatabaseName\n);\n\n\n  \ncontext\n \n=\n \nManagedContext\n(\ndataModel\n,\n \npersistentStore\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen our application starts, our channel has access to an \noptions\n property that has the command-line arguments that started the application. By default, the value of \nconfigurationFilePath\n is \nconfig.yaml\n (it corresponds to \n--config-path\n in \naqueduct serve\n). When \nconfig.yaml\n is read, its values are read into a \nHeroConfig\n and are used to configure our database connection.\n\n\nRe-run your application and it'll work exactly the same as it did before - except now, we can substitute databases depending on how we run the application.\n\n\nConfiguration Template\n\n\nYou shouldn't check \nconfig.yaml\n into version control because it contains sensitive information. However, it is important to check in a \nconfiguration source file\n. A configuration source file has the same structure as \nHeroConfig\n, but it has values for your test environment - both locally and with continuous integration tools. It is also used as a template for your deployed configuration files.\n\n\n\n\nSensitive Information\n\n\nUse a platform like Heroku or Kubernetes. You can store sensitive information in secured environment variables. You can substitute environment variables in a configuration file by using the variable's name with a \n$\n prefix as a value, e.g. \npassword: $DATABASE_PASSWORD\n.\n\n\n\n\nA configuration source file should be named \nconfig.src.yaml\n, and one currently exists as an empty file in your project. Enter the following configuration into this file:\n\n\ndatabase:\n\n  \nhost:\n \nlocalhost\n\n  \nport:\n \n5432\n\n  \nusername:\n \ndart\n\n  \npassword:\n \ndart\n\n  \ndatabaseName:\n \ndart_test\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis file has the expected structure, but has different values for the database information (for a database that we will create shortly). In the next section, we'll use this configuration file to run our automated tests.\n\n\nTesting in Aqueduct\n\n\nSo far, we've tested our application by using a web application. This isn't a good way to test an application. A better way is to write automated test cases. An automated test case not only tests the code you are working on, but makes sure the code you've worked on the past continues to work as you make changes. A good development practice is to configure \nTravisCI\n to run all of your tests for every code change.\n\n\nBecause testing is so important, there is a package for writing Aqueduct application tests. In this chapter, we will use this package to make sure our hero endpoints are working correctly.\n\n\n\n\npackage:aqueduct_test\n\n\nThe package \naqueduct_test\n and \ntest\n was already added to your \npubspec.yaml\n file as a test dependency by the template generator.\n\n\n\n\nIn all Dart applications, a test suite is a Dart script with a \nmain\n function. In this function, the \ntest\n function is called multiple times to register expectations. A test passes if all of your expectations are met. An example Dart test looks like this:\n\n\nimport\n \npackage:test/test.dart\n;\n\n\n\nvoid\n \nmain\n()\n \n{\n\n  \ntest\n(\n1+1 = 2\n,\n \n()\n \n{\n\n    \n// Expect that 1 + 1 = 2\n\n    \nexpect\n(\n1\n \n+\n \n1\n,\n \nequals\n(\n2\n));\n\n  \n});\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting up your Development Environment\n\n\nIn \nconfig.src.yaml\n, we target the database \ndart:dart@localhost:5432/dart_test\n. This is a 'special' database that is used by all Aqueduct applications for automated testing (by default). When your application is tested, its tables are temporarily added to this database and then discarded after tests complete. This means that no data is stored in between test runs.\n\n\nCreate this database by running \npsql\n and enter the following SQL:\n\n\nCREATE\n \nDATABASE\n \ndart_test\n;\n\n\nCREATE\n \nUSER\n \ndart\n \nWITH\n \ncreatedb\n;\n\n\nALTER\n \nUSER\n \ndart\n \nWITH\n \npassword\n \ndart\n;\n\n\nGRANT\n \nall\n \nON\n \ndatabase\n \ndart_test\n \nTO\n \ndart\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndart_test Database\n\n\nYou only have to create this database once per machine, and in any continuous integration scripts. All of your Aqueduct applications will use this database for automated testing. Fun fact - you can run multiple application's tests simultaneously using this database because the tables only exist for the database connection that created them.\n\n\n\n\nWriting Your First Test\n\n\nWe will create a test suite to make sure that all hero endpoints return the right data, and make the right changes. Create a new file named \ntest/hero_controller_test.dart\n.\n\n\n\n\nTest Files Names and Locations\n\n\nA test file must end in \n_test.dart\n and must be in the \ntest/\n directory of your project, or it won't be run.\n\n\n\n\nAt the top of this file, import your application's \ntest harness\n and enter the following \nmain\n function:\n\n\nimport\n \nharness/app.dart\n;\n\n\n\nvoid\n \nmain\n()\n \n{\n\n  \nfinal\n \nharness\n \n=\n \nHarness\n()..\ninstall\n();\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA test harness is an object that starts and stops your application when running a test suite, as long as you call its \ninstall\n method. This harness can then send requests to your application, and you can expect that the response is correct. Add a test to the main function that makes sure we get back a 200 OK when we call \nGET /heroes\n:\n\n\nvoid\n \nmain\n()\n \n{\n\n  \nfinal\n \nharness\n \n=\n \nHarness\n()..\ninstall\n();\n\n\n  \ntest\n(\nGET /heroes returns 200 OK\n,\n \n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nfinal\n \nresponse\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nharness\n.\nagent\n.\nget\n(\n/heroes\n);\n\n    \nexpectResponse\n(\nresponse\n,\n \n200\n);\n\n  \n});\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA harness has an \nAgent\n that can send requests to the application it started. Methods like \nget\n and \npost\n take a path (and optionally headers and a body) and return a response object. This object is used in \nexpectResponse\n to validate the status code and other values. Tests in Aqueduct are written in this way: make a request, expect that the response is intended.\n\n\nBecause our application makes database queries, we have to to upload our database schema to the test database before each test. Fortunately, this is something our test harness can also do. In \ntest/harness/app.dart\n, mixin \nTestHarnessORMMixin\n and override two methods:\n\n\nclass\n \nHarness\n \nextends\n \nTestHarness\nHeroesChannel\n \nwith\n \nTestHarnessORMMixin\n \n{\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nManagedContext\n \nget\n \ncontext\n \n=\n \nchannel\n.\ncontext\n;\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nFuture\n \nonSetUp\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nawait\n \nresetData\n();\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mixin gives our harness the method \nresetData\n. This method deletes everything from the test database and uploads the schema in a pristine state. By calling this method in \nonSetUp\n, our test harness will reset data before each test.\n\n\n\n\nNew Project Templates\n\n\nUsing the \n-t\n command-line argument with \naqueduct create\n allows you to select a template. Templates like \ndb\n and \ndb_and_auth\n have a test harness that already mixes in \nTestHarnessORMMixin\n.\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can run this test by right-clicking on the \nmain\n function in \nhero_controller_test.dart\n and selecting \nRun tests in 'hero_controller_test.dart'\n. A panel will appear that shows the results of your tests. You'll see a green checkmark next to the test in this panel to show that your test succeeded. If your test did not succeed, the reason will be printed to the console. If your test failed because of an error in your code, you will also be able to see the stack trace of the error.\n\n\n\n\nRunning Tests\n\n\nYou can also run all of your tests for an application by running \npub run test\n from your project's directory. You can re-run a test with the green play button at the top right corner of the screen, or the keyboard shortcut associated with it (this shortcut varies depending on your installation).\n\n\n\n\nWe should expect that more than just the status code is correct. Let's verify that the body is a list, where every element is an object that contains an id and name. Update your test:\n\n\ntest\n(\nGET /heroes returns 200 OK\n,\n \n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n  \nfinal\n \nresponse\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nharness\n.\nagent\n.\nget\n(\n/heroes\n);\n\n  \nexpectResponse\n(\nresponse\n,\n \n200\n,\n \nbody:\n \neveryElement\n({\n\n    \nid\n:\n \ngreaterThan\n(\n0\n),\n\n    \nname\n:\n \nisString\n,\n\n  \n}));\n\n\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis expectation ensures that the body is a list and that every element is an object with a \nid\n greater than 0, and a \nname\n that is a string. When expecting a body value, the body is first decoded from its content-type before the expectation. In practice, this means that your JSON response body is deserialized into an object or list. Your expectations of the body are built from Dart objects like \nList\n and \nObject\n that deserialized from JSON.\n\n\n\n\nMatchers\n\n\nThe function \neveryElement\n is a \nMatcher\n from \npackage:matcher\n. There are many types of matchers for all kinds of scenarios, and \npackage:aqueduct_test\n includes Aqueduct-specific matchers. See the \naqueduct_test API Reference\n for all Aqueduct matchers.\n\n\n\n\nThis test actually has an error that we will fix in it by using another matcher. Right now, this endpoint returns an \nempty list\n because there are no heroes in the database! Let's insert a hero before we make this request, and also expect that there is at least one element in the body. Make sure to import \nhero.dart\n at the top of the file!\n\n\nimport\n \npackage:heroes/model/hero.dart\n;\n\n\n\nimport\n \nharness/app.dart\n;\n\n\n\nvoid\n \nmain\n()\n \n{\n\n  \nfinal\n \nharness\n \n=\n \nHarness\n()..\ninstall\n();\n\n\n  \ntest\n(\nGET /heroes returns 200 OK\n,\n \n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nfinal\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nHero\n(\nharness\n.\napplication\n.\nchannel\n.\ncontext\n)\n\n      \n..\nvalues\n.\nname\n \n=\n \nBob\n;\n\n\n    \nawait\n \nquery\n.\ninsert\n();\n\n\n    \nfinal\n \nresponse\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nharness\n.\nagent\n.\nget\n(\n/heroes\n);\n\n    \nexpectResponse\n(\nresponse\n,\n \n200\n,\n\n        \nbody:\n \nallOf\n([\n\n          \nhasLength\n(\ngreaterThan\n(\n0\n)),\n\n          \neveryElement\n({\n\n            \nid\n:\n \ngreaterThan\n(\n0\n),\n\n            \nname\n:\n \nisString\n,\n\n          \n})\n\n        \n]));\n\n  \n});\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis test first inserts a hero named 'Bob' before getting all heroes. We compose a matcher where each element has to match the expected list, but also have a length greater than 0. Re-run your tests, and they should still pass.\n\n\nWriting More Tests\n\n\nLet's write a few more tests for when we \nPOST /heroes\n. In the first test, we'll make a mistake on purpose to see how tests fail. Add the following test:\n\n\ntest\n(\nPOST /heroes returns 200 OK\n,\n \n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n  \nfinal\n \nresponse\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nharness\n.\nagent\n.\npost\n(\n/heroes\n,\n \nbody:\n \n{\n\n    \nname\n:\n \nFred\n\n  \n});\n\n  \nexpectResponse\n(\nresponse\n,\n \n200\n,\n \nbody:\n \n{\n\n    \nid\n:\n \ngreaterThan\n(\n0\n),\n\n    \nname\n:\n \nBob\n\n  \n});\n\n\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis test creates a hero named 'Fred', but expects that the returned hero has the name 'Bob'. When we run the test, we see this test failure:\n\n\nExpected\n:\n \n---\n \nHTTP\n \nResponse\n \n---\n\n          \n-\n \nStatus\n \ncode\n \nmust\n \nbe\n \n200\n\n          \n-\n \nHeaders\n \ncan\n \nbe\n \nanything\n\n          \n-\n \nBody\n \nafter\n \ndecoding\n \nmust\n \nbe\n:\n\n\n            \n{\nid\n:\n \na\n \nvalue\n \ngreater\n \nthan\n \n0\n,\n \nname\n:\n \nBob\n}\n\n          \n---------------------\n\n  \nActual\n:\n \nTestResponse\n:\n-----------\n\n          \n-\n \nStatus\n \ncode\n \nis\n \n200\n\n          \n-\n \nHeaders\n \nare\n \nthe\n \nfollowing\n:\n\n            \n-\n \ncontent-encoding\n:\n \ngzip\n\n            \n-\n \ncontent-length\n:\n \n42\n\n            \n-\n \nx-frame-options\n:\n \nSAMEORIGIN\n\n            \n-\n \ncontent-type\n:\n \napplication\n/\njson\n;\n \ncharset\n=\nutf-8\n\n            \n-\n \nx-xss-protection\n:\n \n1\n;\n \nmode\n=\nblock\n\n            \n-\n \nx-content-type-options\n:\n \nnosniff\n\n            \n-\n \nserver\n:\n \naqueduct\n/\n1\n\n          \nDecoded\n \nbody\n \nis\n:\n\n          \n{\nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n \nname\n:\n \nFred\n}\n\n          \n-------------------------\n\n          \n\n   \nWhich\n:\n \nthe\n \nbody\n \ndiffers\n \nfor\n \nthe\n \nfollowing\n \nreasons\n:\n\n          \nwas\n \nFred\n \ninstead\n \nof\n \nBob\n \nat\n \nlocation\n \n[\nname\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 'Expected' value tells us the response we expected - that it has a status code of 200, any headers and the body must have a certain structure. The 'Actual' value tells us what the actual response was - a 200 OK, a bunch of headers, and a body a hero named 'Fred'. 'Which' tells us exactly what went wrong - we were expected 'Bob', not 'Fred'. Let's update our test to expect 'Fred'.\n\n\ntest\n(\nPOST /heroes returns 200 OK\n,\n \n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n  \nfinal\n \nresponse\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nharness\n.\nagent\n.\npost\n(\n/heroes\n,\n \nbody:\n \n{\n\n    \nname\n:\n \nFred\n\n  \n});\n\n  \nexpectResponse\n(\nresponse\n,\n \n200\n,\n \nbody:\n \n{\n\n    \nid\n:\n \ngreaterThan\n(\n0\n),\n\n    \nname\n:\n \nFred\n\n  \n});\n\n\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe shouldn't just test success cases. Let's also expect that if we try and insert a hero with the same name, we get a 409 error response.\n\n\ntest\n(\nPOST /heroes returns 200 OK\n,\n \n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n  \nawait\n \nharness\n.\nagent\n.\npost\n(\n/heroes\n,\n \nbody:\n \n{\n\n    \nname\n:\n \nFred\n\n  \n});\n\n\n  \nfinal\n \nbadResponse\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nharness\n.\nagent\n.\npost\n(\n/heroes\n,\n \nbody:\n \n{\n\n    \nname\n:\n \nFred\n\n  \n});\n\n  \nexpectResponse\n(\nbadResponse\n,\n \n409\n);\n\n\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this test, we request two 'Fred' heroes be created, and the second request fails with a 409 because \nname\n is a unique property of a hero. Notice that the first request didn't fail, even though we had created a 'Fred' hero in the previous test - that's because we reset the database for each test in our harness.\n\n\nNext Chapter: Authentication and Authorization",

This is bad because we want to use a different database when we're testing, running locally and running in production. It's also bad because we'd have to check our database password into version control.  We can create an configuration file to store values like database connection information, and use a different configuration file for each environment. The  heroes  application needs to be able to configure the username, password, host port and name of the database it uses. Open the file  config.yaml , which is empty, and enter the following key-value pairs:  database : \n   host :   localhost \n   port :   5432 \n   username :   heroes_user \n   password :   password \n   databaseName :   heroes   These are the same values we used in our application channel. We'll want to replace the hardcoded values with whatever values are in this file. In  lib/channel.dart , declare a new class at the bottom of the file:  class   HeroConfig   extends   Configuration   { \n   HeroConfig ( String   path ) :   super . fromFile ( File ( path )); \n\n   DatabaseConfiguration   database ;  }   A  Configuration  subclass declares the expected properties of a configuration file.  HeroConfig  has one property named  database  - this matches the name of our top-level key in  config.yaml . A  DatabaseConfiguration  is a built-in configuration type that has properties for  host ,  port ,  username ,  password  and  databaseName . We can load  config.yaml  into a  HeroConfig  because they have the same structure and all of the key names match the property names in our configuration types.   Invalid Configuration  If your configuration file and configuration object don't have a matching structure, an error will be thrown when your application starts and tell you which values are missing.   Let's load  config.yaml  and use its values to set up our database connection by replacing the  prepare  method in  lib/channel.dart :  @ override  Future   prepare ()   async   { \n   logger . onRecord . listen ( \n       ( rec )   =   print ( $ rec   ${ rec . error   ??   }   ${ rec . stackTrace   ??   } )); \n\n   final   config   =   HeroConfig ( options . configurationFilePath ); \n   final   dataModel   =   ManagedDataModel . fromCurrentMirrorSystem (); \n   final   persistentStore   =   PostgreSQLPersistentStore . fromConnectionInfo ( \n       config . database . username , \n       config . database . password , \n       config . database . host , \n       config . database . port , \n       config . database . databaseName ); \n\n   context   =   ManagedContext ( dataModel ,   persistentStore );  }   When our application starts, our channel has access to an  options  property that has the command-line arguments that started the application. By default, the value of  configurationFilePath  is  config.yaml  (it corresponds to  --config-path  in  aqueduct serve ). When  config.yaml  is read, its values are read into a  HeroConfig  and are used to configure our database connection.

Update your test:  test ( GET /heroes returns 200 OK ,   ()   async   { \n   final   response   =   await   harness . agent . get ( /heroes ); \n   expectResponse ( response ,   200 ,   body:   everyElement ({ \n     id :   greaterThan ( 0 ), \n     name :   isString , \n   }));  });   This expectation ensures that the body is a list and that every element is an object with a  id  greater than 0, and a  name  that is a string. When expecting a body value, the body is first decoded from its content-type before the expectation. In practice, this means that your JSON response body is deserialized into an object or list. Your expectations of the body are built from Dart objects like  List  and  Object  that deserialized from JSON.   Matchers  The function  everyElement  is a  Matcher  from  package:matcher . There are many types of matchers for all kinds of scenarios, and  package:aqueduct_test  includes Aqueduct-specific matchers. See the  aqueduct_test API Reference  for all Aqueduct matchers.   This test actually has an error that we will fix in it by using another matcher. Right now, this endpoint returns an  empty list  because there are no heroes in the database! Let's insert a hero before we make this request, and also expect that there is at least one element in the body. Make sure to import  hero.dart  at the top of the file!  import   package:heroes/model/hero.dart ;  import   harness/app.dart ;  void   main ()   { \n   final   harness   =   Harness ().. install (); \n\n   test ( GET /heroes returns 200 OK ,   ()   async   { \n     final   query   =   Query Hero ( harness . application . channel . context ) \n       .. values . name   =   Bob ; \n\n     await   query . insert (); \n\n     final   response   =   await   harness . agent . get ( /heroes ); \n     expectResponse ( response ,   200 , \n         body:   allOf ([ \n           hasLength ( greaterThan ( 0 )), \n           everyElement ({ \n             id :   greaterThan ( 0 ), \n             name :   isString , \n           }) \n         ])); \n   });  }   This test first inserts a hero named 'Bob' before getting all heroes. We compose a matcher where each element has to match the expected list, but also have a length greater than 0. Re-run your tests, and they should still pass.",

The 'Actual' value tells us what the actual response was - a 200 OK, a bunch of headers, and a body a hero named 'Fred'. 'Which' tells us exactly what went wrong - we were expected 'Bob', not 'Fred'. Let's update our test to expect 'Fred'.  test ( POST /heroes returns 200 OK ,   ()   async   { \n   final   response   =   await   harness . agent . post ( /heroes ,   body:   { \n     name :   Fred \n   }); \n   expectResponse ( response ,   200 ,   body:   { \n     id :   greaterThan ( 0 ), \n     name :   Fred \n   });  });   We shouldn't just test success cases.

We will continue to build on the last chapter's project, \nheroes\n, requiring a user to log in before viewing or creating heroes.\n\n\n\n\nWe're Done With the Browser App\n\n\nWe're at the point now where using the browser application to test our Aqueduct app gets a bit cumbersome. From here on out, we'll use \ncurl\n, \naqueduct document client\n and tests.\n\n\n\n\nThe Basics of OAuth 2.0\n\n\nOAuth 2.0\n is an authorization framework that also contains guidance on authentication. Authentication is the process of proving you are a particular user, typically through a username and password. Authorization is the process of ensuring that a user can access a particular resource or collection of resources. In our application, a user will have to be authenticated before being authorized to view or create heroes.\n\n\nIn a simple authentication and authorization scheme, each HTTP request contains the username and password (credentials) of the user in an \nAuthorization\n header. There are a number of security risks involved in doing this, so OAuth 2.0 takes another approach: you send your credentials once, and get a 'access token' in return. You then send this access token in each request. Because the server grants the token, it knows that you've already entered your credentials (you've \nauthenticated\n) and it remembers who the token belongs to. It's effectively the same thing as sending your credentials each time, except that the token has a time limit and can be revoked when things go wrong.\n\n\nAqueduct has a built-in OAuth 2.0 implementation that leverages the ORM. This implementation is part of the \naqueduct\n package, but it is a separate library named \naqueduct/managed_auth\n. It takes a few steps to set up that might be difficult to understand if you are not familiar with OAuth 2.0, but you'll get a well-tested, secure authorization implementation.\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Implementations\n\n\nUsing \npackage:aqueduct/managed_auth\n is preferable in most cases. In some cases, you may wish to store authorization information in different database system or use token formats like \nJWT\n. This is a complex topic that requires significant testing efforts, and is outside the scope of this tutorial.\n\n\n\n\nSetting up OAuth 2.0: Creating a User Type\n\n\nOur application needs some concept of a 'user' - a person who logs into the application to manage heroes. This user will have a username and password. In a later exercise, a user will also have a list of heroes that belong to them. Create a new file \nmodel/user.dart\n and enter the following code:\n\n\nimport\n \npackage:aqueduct/managed_auth.dart\n;\n\n\nimport\n \npackage:heroes/heroes.dart\n;\n\n\nimport\n \npackage:heroes/model/hero.dart\n;\n\n\n\nclass\n \nUser\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_User\n \nimplements\n \n_User\n,\n \nManagedAuthResourceOwner\n_User\n \n{}\n\n\n\nclass\n \n_User\n \nextends\n \nResourceOwnerTableDefinition\n \n{}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe imported library \npackage:aqueduct/managed_auth.dart\n contains types that use the ORM to store users, tokens and other OAuth 2.0 related data. One of those types is \nResourceOwnerTableDefinition\n, the superclass of our user's table definition. This type contains all of the required fields that Aqueduct needs to implement authentication.\n\n\n\n\nResource Owners\n\n\nA \nresource owner\n is a more general term for a 'user' that comes from the OAuth 2.0 specification. In the framework, you'll see types and variables using some variant of \nresource owner\n, but for all intents and purposes, you can consider this a 'user'.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are curious, \nResourceOwnerTableDefinition\n looks like this:\n\n\nclass\n \nResourceOwnerTableDefinition\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nprimaryKey\n\n  \nint\n \nid\n;\n\n\n  \n@\nColumn\n(\nunique:\n \ntrue\n,\n \nindexed:\n \ntrue\n)\n\n  \nString\n \nusername\n;\n\n\n  \n@\nColumn\n(\nomitByDefault:\n \ntrue\n)\n\n  \nString\n \nhashedPassword\n;\n\n\n  \n@\nColumn\n(\nomitByDefault:\n \ntrue\n)\n\n  \nString\n \nsalt\n;\n\n\n  \nManagedSet\nManagedAuthToken\n \ntokens\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause these fields are in \nUser\n's table definition, our \nUser\n table has all of these database columns.\n\n\n\n\nManagedAuthResourceOwner\n\n\nNote that \nUser\n implements \nManagedAuthResourceOwner\n_User\n - this is a requirement of any OAuth 2.0 resource owner type when using \npackage:aqueduct/managed_auth\n.\n\n\n\n\nSetting up OAuth 2.0: AuthServer and its Delegate\n\n\nNow that we have a user, we need some way to create new users and authenticate them. Authentication is fairly tricky, especially in OAuth 2.0, so there is a service object that does the hard part for us called an \nAuthServer\n. This type has all of the logic needed to authentication and authorize users. For example, an \nAuthServer\n can generate a new token if given valid user credentials.\n\n\nIn \nchannel.dart\n, add the following imports to the top of your file:\n\n\nimport\n \npackage:aqueduct/managed_auth.dart\n;\n\n\nimport\n \npackage:heroes/model/user.dart\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, declare a new \nauthServer\n property in your channel and initialize it in \nprepare\n:\n\n\nclass\n \nHeroesChannel\n \nextends\n \nApplicationChannel\n \n{\n\n  \nManagedContext\n \ncontext\n;\n\n\n  \n// Add this field\n\n  \nAuthServer\n \nauthServer\n;\n\n\n  \nFuture\n \nprepare\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nlogger\n.\nonRecord\n.\nlisten\n((\nrec\n)\n \n=\n \nprint\n(\n$\nrec\n \n${\nrec\n.\nerror\n \n??\n \n}\n \n${\nrec\n.\nstackTrace\n \n??\n \n}\n));\n\n\n    \nfinal\n \nconfig\n \n=\n \nHeroConfig\n(\noptions\n.\nconfigurationFilePath\n);\n\n    \nfinal\n \ndataModel\n \n=\n \nManagedDataModel\n.\nfromCurrentMirrorSystem\n();\n\n    \nfinal\n \npersistentStore\n \n=\n \nPostgreSQLPersistentStore\n.\nfromConnectionInfo\n(\n\n      \nconfig\n.\ndatabase\n.\nusername\n,\n\n      \nconfig\n.\ndatabase\n.\npassword\n,\n\n      \nconfig\n.\ndatabase\n.\nhost\n,\n\n      \nconfig\n.\ndatabase\n.\nport\n,\n\n      \nconfig\n.\ndatabase\n.\ndatabaseName\n);\n\n\n    \ncontext\n \n=\n \nManagedContext\n(\ndataModel\n,\n \npersistentStore\n);\n\n\n    \n// Add these two lines:\n\n    \nfinal\n \nauthStorage\n \n=\n \nManagedAuthDelegate\nUser\n(\ncontext\n);\n\n    \nauthServer\n \n=\n \nAuthServer\n(\nauthStorage\n);\n\n  \n}\n\n  \n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile an \nAuthServer\n handles the logic of authentication and authorization, it doesn't know how to store or fetch the data it uses for those tasks. Instead, it relies on a \ndelegate\n object to handle storing and fetching data from a database. In our application, we use \nManagedAuthDelegate\nT\n - from \npackage:aqueduct/managed_auth\n - as the delegate. This type uses the ORM for these tasks; the type argument must be our application's user object.\n\n\n\n\nDelegation\n\n\nDelegation is a design pattern where an object has multiple callbacks that are grouped into an interface. Instead of defining a closure for each callback, a type implements methods that get called by the delegating object. It is a way of organizing large amounts of related callbacks into a tidy class.\n\n\n\n\nBy importing \naqueduct/managed_auth\n, we've added a few more managed objects to our application (to store tokens and other authentication data) and we also have a new \nUser\n managed object. It's a good time to run a database migration. From your project directory, run the following commands:\n\n\naqueduct db generate\naqueduct db upgrade --connect postgres://heroes_user:password@localhost:5432/heroes\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting up OAuth 2.0: Registering Users\n\n\nNow that we have the concept of a user, our database and application are set up to handle authentication, we can start creating new users. Let's create a new controller for registering users. This controller will accept \nPOST\n requests that contain a username and password in the body. It will insert a new user into the database and securely hash the user's password.\n\n\nBefore we create this controller, there is something we need to consider: our registration endpoint will require the user's password, but we store the user's password as a cryptographic hash. This prevents someone with access to your database from knowing a user's password. In order to bind the body of a request to a \nUser\n object, it needs a password field, but we don't want to store the password in the database without first hashing it.\n\n\nWe can accomplish this with \ntransient properties\n. A transient property is a property of a managed object that isn't stored in the database. They are declared in the managed object subclass instead of the table definition. By default, a transient property is not read from a request body or encoded into a response body; unless we add the \nSerialize\n annotation to it. Add this property to your \nUser\n type:\n\n\nclass\n \nUser\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_User\n \nimplements\n \n_User\n,\n \nManagedAuthResourceOwner\n_User\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nSerialize\n(\ninput:\n \ntrue\n,\n \noutput:\n \nfalse\n)\n\n  \nString\n \npassword\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis declares that a \nUser\n has a transient property \npassword\n that can be read on input (from a request body), but is not sent on output (to a response body). We don't have to run a database migration because transient properties are not stored in a database.\n\n\nNow, create the file \ncontroller/register_controller.dart\n and enter the following code:\n\n\nimport\n \ndart:async\n;\n\n\n\nimport\n \npackage:aqueduct/aqueduct.dart\n;\n\n\nimport\n \npackage:heroes/model/user.dart\n;\n\n\n\nclass\n \nRegisterController\n \nextends\n \nResourceController\n \n{\n\n  \nRegisterController\n(\nthis\n.\ncontext\n,\n \nthis\n.\nauthServer\n);\n\n\n  \nfinal\n \nManagedContext\n \ncontext\n;\n\n  \nfinal\n \nAuthServer\n \nauthServer\n;\n\n\n  \n@\nOperation\n.\npost\n()\n\n  \nFuture\nResponse\n \ncreateUser\n(\n@\nBind\n.\nbody\n()\n \nUser\n \nuser\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \n// Check for required parameters before we spend time hashing\n\n    \nif\n \n(\nuser\n.\nusername\n \n==\n \nnull\n \n||\n \nuser\n.\npassword\n \n==\n \nnull\n)\n \n{\n\n      \nreturn\n \nResponse\n.\nbadRequest\n(\n\n        \nbody:\n \n{\nerror\n:\n \nusername and password required.\n});\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nuser\n\n      \n..\nsalt\n \n=\n \nAuthUtility\n.\ngenerateRandomSalt\n()\n\n      \n..\nhashedPassword\n \n=\n \nauthServer\n.\nhashPassword\n(\nuser\n.\npassword\n,\n \nuser\n.\nsalt\n);\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\nawait\n \nQuery\n(\ncontext\n,\n \nvalues:\n \nuser\n).\ninsert\n());\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis controller takes POST requests that contain a user. A user has many fields (username, password, hashedPassword, salt), but we will calculate the latter two and only require that the request contain the first two. The controller generates a salt and hash of the password before storing it in the database. In \nchannel.dart\n, let's link this controller - don't forget to import it!\n\n\nimport\n \npackage:heroes/controller/register_controller.dart\n;\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nController\n \nget\n \nentryPoint\n \n{\n\n    \nfinal\n \nrouter\n \n=\n \nRouter\n();\n\n\n    \nrouter\n\n      \n.\nroute\n(\n/heroes/[:id]\n)\n\n      \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nHeroesController\n(\ncontext\n));\n\n\n      \nrouter\n\n      \n.\nroute\n(\n/register\n)\n\n      \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nRegisterController\n(\ncontext\n,\n \nauthServer\n));\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nrouter\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nLet's run the application and create a new user using \ncurl\n from the command-line. (We'll specify \n-n1\n to designate using one isolate and speed up startup.)\n\n\naqueduct serve -n1\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, issue a request to your server:\n\n\ncurl\n \n-\nX\n \nPOST\n \nhttp:\n//localhost:8888/register -H \nContent-Type: application/json\n -d \n{\nusername\n:\nbob\n, \npassword\n:\npassword\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll get back the new user object and its username:\n\n\n{\nid\n:1,\nusername\n:\nbob\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting up OAuth 2.0: Authenticating Users\n\n\nNow that we have a user with a password, we can can create an endpoint that takes user credentials and returns an access token. The good news is that this controller already exists in Aqueduct, you just have to hook it up to a route. Update \nentryPoint\n in \nchannel.dart\n to add an \nAuthController\n for the route \n/auth/token\n:\n\n\n@\noverride\n\n\nController\n \nget\n \nentryPoint\n \n{\n\n  \nfinal\n \nrouter\n \n=\n \nRouter\n();\n\n\n  \n// add this route\n\n  \nrouter\n\n    \n.\nroute\n(\n/auth/token\n)\n\n    \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nAuthController\n(\nauthServer\n));\n\n\n  \nrouter\n\n    \n.\nroute\n(\n/heroes/[:id]\n)\n\n    \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nHeroesController\n(\ncontext\n));\n\n\n  \nrouter\n\n    \n.\nroute\n(\n/register\n)\n\n    \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nRegisterController\n(\ncontext\n,\n \nauthServer\n));\n\n\n  \nreturn\n \nrouter\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn \nAuthController\n follows the OAuth 2.0 specification for granting access tokens when given valid user credentials. To understand how a request to this endpoint must be structured, we need to discuss OAuth 2.0 \nclients\n. In OAuth 2.0, a client is an application that is allowed to access your server on behalf of a user. A client can be a browser application, a mobile application, another server, a voice assistant, etc. A client always has an identifier string, typically something like 'com.stablekernel.account_app.mobile'.\n\n\nWhen authenticating, a user is always authenticated through a client. This client information must be attached to every authentication request, and the server must validate that the client had been previously registered. Therefore, we need to register a new client for our application. A client is stored in our application's database using the \naqueduct auth add-client\n CLI. Run the following command from your project directory:\n\n\naqueduct auth add-client --id com.heroes.tutorial --connect postgres://heroes_user:password@localhost:5432/heroes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOAuth 2.0 Clients\n\n\nA client must have an identifier, but it may also have a secret, redirect URI and list of allowed scopes. See the \nguides on OAuth 2.0\n for how these options impacts authentication. Most notably, a client identifier must have a secret to issue a \nrefresh token\n.

            "text": "OAuth 2.0  is an authorization framework that also contains guidance on authentication. Authentication is the process of proving you are a particular user, typically through a username and password. Authorization is the process of ensuring that a user can access a particular resource or collection of resources. In our application, a user will have to be authenticated before being authorized to view or create heroes.  In a simple authentication and authorization scheme, each HTTP request contains the username and password (credentials) of the user in an  Authorization  header. There are a number of security risks involved in doing this, so OAuth 2.0 takes another approach: you send your credentials once, and get a 'access token' in return. You then send this access token in each request. Because the server grants the token, it knows that you've already entered your credentials (you've  authenticated ) and it remembers who the token belongs to. It's effectively the same thing as sending your credentials each time, except that the token has a time limit and can be revoked when things go wrong.  Aqueduct has a built-in OAuth 2.0 implementation that leverages the ORM. This implementation is part of the  aqueduct  package, but it is a separate library named  aqueduct/managed_auth . It takes a few steps to set up that might be difficult to understand if you are not familiar with OAuth 2.0, but you'll get a well-tested, secure authorization implementation.   Alternative Implementations  Using  package:aqueduct/managed_auth  is preferable in most cases. In some cases, you may wish to store authorization information in different database system or use token formats like  JWT . This is a complex topic that requires significant testing efforts, and is outside the scope of this tutorial.",

Resource Owners  A  resource owner  is a more general term for a 'user' that comes from the OAuth 2.0 specification. In the framework, you'll see types and variables using some variant of  resource owner , but for all intents and purposes, you can consider this a 'user'.

Authentication is fairly tricky, especially in OAuth 2.0, so there is a service object that does the hard part for us called an  AuthServer . This type has all of the logic needed to authentication and authorize users. For example, an  AuthServer  can generate a new token if given valid user credentials.  In  channel.dart , add the following imports to the top of your file:  import   package:aqueduct/managed_auth.dart ;  import   package:heroes/model/user.dart ;   Then, declare a new  authServer  property in your channel and initialize it in  prepare :  class   HeroesChannel   extends   ApplicationChannel   { \n   ManagedContext   context ; \n\n   // Add this field \n   AuthServer   authServer ; \n\n   Future   prepare ()   async   { \n     logger . onRecord . listen (( rec )   =   print ( $ rec   ${ rec . error   ??   }   ${ rec . stackTrace   ??   } )); \n\n     final   config   =   HeroConfig ( options . configurationFilePath ); \n     final   dataModel   =   ManagedDataModel . fromCurrentMirrorSystem (); \n     final   persistentStore   =   PostgreSQLPersistentStore . fromConnectionInfo ( \n       config . database . username , \n       config . database . password , \n       config . database . host , \n       config . database . port , \n       config . database . databaseName ); \n\n     context   =   ManagedContext ( dataModel ,   persistentStore ); \n\n     // Add these two lines: \n     final   authStorage   =   ManagedAuthDelegate User ( context ); \n     authServer   =   AuthServer ( authStorage ); \n   } \n   ...   While an  AuthServer  handles the logic of authentication and authorization, it doesn't know how to store or fetch the data it uses for those tasks. Instead, it relies on a  delegate  object to handle storing and fetching data from a database. In our application, we use  ManagedAuthDelegate T  - from  package:aqueduct/managed_auth  - as the delegate. This type uses the ORM for these tasks; the type argument must be our application's user object.   Delegation  Delegation is a design pattern where an object has multiple callbacks that are grouped into an interface. Instead of defining a closure for each callback, a type implements methods that get called by the delegating object. It is a way of organizing large amounts of related callbacks into a tidy class.   By importing  aqueduct/managed_auth , we've added a few more managed objects to our application (to store tokens and other authentication data) and we also have a new  User  managed object. It's a good time to run a database migration.

Let's create a new controller for registering users. This controller will accept  POST  requests that contain a username and password in the body. It will insert a new user into the database and securely hash the user's password.  Before we create this controller, there is something we need to consider: our registration endpoint will require the user's password, but we store the user's password as a cryptographic hash. This prevents someone with access to your database from knowing a user's password. In order to bind the body of a request to a  User  object, it needs a password field, but we don't want to store the password in the database without first hashing it.  We can accomplish this with  transient properties . A transient property is a property of a managed object that isn't stored in the database. They are declared in the managed object subclass instead of the table definition. By default, a transient property is not read from a request body or encoded into a response body; unless we add the  Serialize  annotation to it. Add this property to your  User  type:  class   User   extends   ManagedObject _User   implements   _User ,   ManagedAuthResourceOwner _User   { \n   @ Serialize ( input:   true ,   output:   false ) \n   String   password ;  }   This declares that a  User  has a transient property  password  that can be read on input (from a request body), but is not sent on output (to a response body). We don't have to run a database migration because transient properties are not stored in a database.  Now, create the file  controller/register_controller.dart  and enter the following code:  import   dart:async ;  import   package:aqueduct/aqueduct.dart ;  import   package:heroes/model/user.dart ;  class   RegisterController   extends   ResourceController   { \n   RegisterController ( this . context ,   this . authServer ); \n\n   final   ManagedContext   context ; \n   final   AuthServer   authServer ; \n\n   @ Operation . post () \n   Future Response   createUser ( @ Bind . body ()   User   user )   async   { \n     // Check for required parameters before we spend time hashing \n     if   ( user . username   ==   null   ||   user . password   ==   null )   { \n       return   Response . badRequest ( \n         body:   { error :   username and password required. }); \n     } \n\n     user \n       .. salt   =   AuthUtility . generateRandomSalt () \n       .. hashedPassword   =   authServer . hashPassword ( user . password ,   user . salt ); \n\n     return   Response . ok ( await   Query ( context ,   values:   user ). insert ()); \n   }  }   This controller takes POST requests that contain a user. A user has many fields (username, password, hashedPassword, salt), but we will calculate the latter two and only require that the request contain the first two. The controller generates a salt and hash of the password before storing it in the database. In  channel.dart , let's link this controller - don't forget to import it!  import   package:heroes/controller/register_controller.dart ;  ... \n\n   @ override \n   Controller   get   entryPoint   { \n     final   router   =   Router (); \n\n     router \n       . route ( /heroes/[:id] ) \n       . link (()   =   HeroesController ( context )); \n\n       router \n       . route ( /register ) \n       . link (()   =   RegisterController ( context ,   authServer )); \n\n     return   router ; \n   }  }       Let's run the application and create a new user using  curl  from the command-line.

To understand how a request to this endpoint must be structured, we need to discuss OAuth 2.0  clients . In OAuth 2.0, a client is an application that is allowed to access your server on behalf of a user. A client can be a browser application, a mobile application, another server, a voice assistant, etc. A client always has an identifier string, typically something like 'com.stablekernel.account_app.mobile'.  When authenticating, a user is always authenticated through a client. This client information must be attached to every authentication request, and the server must validate that the client had been previously registered. Therefore, we need to register a new client for our application. A client is stored in our application's database using the  aqueduct auth add-client  CLI. Run the following command from your project directory:  aqueduct auth add-client --id com.heroes.tutorial --connect postgres://heroes_user:password@localhost:5432/heroes   OAuth 2.0 Clients  A client must have an identifier, but it may also have a secret, redirect URI and list of allowed scopes. See the  guides on OAuth 2.0  for how these options impacts authentication. Most notably, a client identifier must have a secret to issue a  refresh token . Clients are stored in an application's database.   This will insert a new row into an OAuth 2.0 client table created by our last round of database migration and allow us to make authentication requests. An authentication request must meet all of the following criteria:   the client identifier (and secret, if it exists) are included as a basic  Authorization  header.  the username and password are included in the request body  the key-value  grant_type=password  is included in the request body  the request body content-type is  application/x-www-form-urlencoded ; this means the request body is effectively a query string (e.g.  username=bob password=pw grant_type=password )   In Dart code, this would like this:  import   package:http/http.dart   as   http ;   // Must include http package in your pubspec.yaml  final   clientID   =   com.heroes.tutorial ;  final   body   =   username=bob password=password grant_type=password ;  // Note the trailing colon (:) after the clientID.  // A client identifier secret would follow this, but there is no secret, so it is the empty string.  final   clientCredentials   =   Base64Encoder (). convert ( $ clientID : . codeUnits );  final   response   =   await   http . post ( \n   https://stablekernel.com/auth/token , \n   headers:   { \n     Content-Type :   application/x-www-form-urlencoded , \n     Authorization :   Basic  $ clientCredentials \n   }, \n   body:   body );   You can execute that code or you can use the following  curl :  curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/auth/token -H  Authorization: Basic Y29tLmhlcm9lcy50dXRvcmlhbDo=  -H  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded  -d  username=bob password=password grant_type=password   If you were successful, you'll get the following response containing an access token:  { access_token : 687PWKFHRTQ9MveQ2dKvP95D4cWie1gh , token_type : bearer , expires_in :86399}  Hang on to this access token, we'll use it in a moment.",

A controller is an object that can handle a request in some way. In general, there are two types of controllers:\n\n\n\n\nEndpoint controllers fulfill a request (e.g., insert a row into a database and send a 200 OK response).\n\n\nMiddleware controllers verify something about a request (e.g., verifying the Authorization header has valid credentials) or modify the response created by an endpoint controller (e.g., add a response header).\n\n\n\n\nControllers are linked together - starting with zero or more middleware and ending with an endpoint controller - to form a series of steps a request will go through. Every controller can either pass the request on to its linked controller, or respond to the request itself (in which case, the linked controller never sees the request). For example, an authorizer middleware will let a request pass if it has valid credentials, but will respond with a 401 Unauthorized response if the credentials are invalid. Some controllers, like \nRouter\n, can have multiple controllers linked to it.\n\n\nThese linked controllers are called \nchannels\n. You create and link channels in a subclass of \nApplicationChannel\n. There is one \nApplicationChannel\n subclass per application.\n\n\nBuilding the ApplicationChannel\n\n\nYou must override \nApplicationChannel.entryPoint\n to return the first controller of your application's channel. In the implementation of this method, every controller that will be used in the application is linked to either the entry point in some way. Here's an example:\n\n\nclass\n \nAppChannel\n \nextends\n \nApplicationChannel\n \n{\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nController\n \nget\n \nentryPoint\n \n{\n\n    \nfinal\n \nrouter\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nRouter\n();\n\n\n    \nrouter\n\n      \n.\nroute\n(\n/users\n)\n\n      \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nAuthorizer\n())\n\n      \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nUserController\n());\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nrouter\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis method links together a \nRouter\n, \nAuthorizer\n and \nUserController\n in that order. A request is first handled by the \nRouter\n, and if its path matches '/users', it will be sent to an \nAuthorizer\n. If the \nAuthorizer\n verifies the request, the request is passed to a \nUserController\n for fulfillment.\n\n\nBy contrast, if the request's path doesn't match '/users', the \nRouter\n sends a 404 Not Found response and doesn't pass it to the \nAuthorizer\n. Likewise, if the request isn't authorized, the \nAuthorizer\n will send a 401 Unauthorized response and prevent it from being passed to the \nUserController\n. In other words, a request 'falls out' of the channel once a controller responds to it, so that no further controllers will receive it.\n\n\n\n\nLinking Controllers\n\n\nThe \nlink()\n method takes a closure that creates a new controller. Some controllers get instantiated for each request, and others get reused for every request. See \nthe chapter on controllers\n for more information.\n\n\n\n\nProviding Services for Controllers\n\n\nControllers often need to get (or create) information from outside the application. The most common example is database access, but it could be anything: another REST API, a connected device, etc. A \nservice object\n encapsulates the information and behavior needed to work with an external system. This separation of concerns between controllers and service objects allows for better structured and more testable code.\n\n\nService objects are passed to controllers through their constructor. A controller that needs a database connection, for example, would take a database connection object in its constructor and store it in a property. Services are created by overriding \nprepare()\n in an \nApplicationChannel\n. Here's an example:\n\n\nclass\n \nAppChannel\n \nextends\n \nApplicationChannel\n \n{\n\n  \nPostgreSQLConnection\n \ndatabase\n;\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nFuture\n \nprepare\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \ndatabase\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nPostgreSQLConnection\n();\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nController\n \nget\n \nentryPoint\n \n{\n\n    \nfinal\n \nrouter\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nRouter\n();\n\n\n    \nrouter\n\n      \n.\nroute\n(\n/users\n)\n\n      \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nAuthorizer\n())\n\n      \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nUserController\n(\ndatabase\n));\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nrouter\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that \ndatabase\n is created in \nprepare()\n, stored in a property and passed to each new instance of \nUserController\n. The \nprepare()\n method is always executed before \nentryPoint\n is called.\n\n\nApplication Channel Configuration\n\n\nA benefit to using service objects is that they can be altered depending on the environment the application is running in without requiring changes to our controller code. For example, the database an application will connect to will be different when running in production than when running tests.\n\n\nBesides service configuration, there may be other types of initialization an application wants to take. Common tasks include adding codecs to \nCodecRegistry\n or setting the default \nCORSPolicy\n.\n\n\nAll of this initialization is done in \nprepare()\n.\n\n\nSome of the information needed to configure an application will come from a configuration file or environment variables. This information is available through the \noptions\n property of an application channel. For more information on using a configuration file and environment variables to guide initialization, see \nthis guide\n.\n\n\nMulti-threaded Aqueduct Applications\n\n\nAqueduct applications can - and should - be spread across a number of threads. This allows an application to take advantage of multiple CPUs and serve requests faster. In Dart, threads are called \nisolates\n. An instance of your \nApplicationChannel\n is created for each isolate. When your application receives an HTTP request, one of these instances receives the request and processes it. These instances are replicas of one another and it doesn't matter which instance processes the request. This isolate-channel architecture is very similar to running multiple servers that run the same application.\n\n\nThe number of isolates an application will use is configurable at startup when using the \naqueduct serve\n command.\n\n\nAn isolate can't share memory with another isolate. If an object is created on one isolate, it \ncannot\n be referenced by another. Therefore, each \nApplicationChannel\n instance has its own set of services that are configured in the same way. This behavior also makes design patterns like connection pooling implicit; instead of a pool of database connections, there is a pool of application channels that each have their own database connection.\n\n\nThis architecture intentionally prevents you from keeping state in your application. When you scale to multiple servers, you can trust that your cluster works correctly because you are already effectively clustering on a single server node. For further reading on writing multi-threaded applications, see \nthis guide\n.\n\n\nInitialization Callbacks\n\n\nBoth \nprepare()\n and \nentryPoint\n are part of the initialization process of an application channel. Most applications only ever need these two methods. Another method, that is rarely used, is \nwillStartReceivingRequests()\n. This method is called after \nprepare()\n and \nentryPoint\n have been executed, and right before your application will start receiving requests.\n\n\nThese three initialization callbacks are called once per isolate to initialize the channel running on that isolate. For initialization that should only occur \nonce per application start\n (regardless of how many isolates are running), an \nApplicationChannel\n subclass can implement a static method named \ninitializeApplication()\n.\n\n\nclass\n \nAppChannel\n \nextends\n \nApplicationChannel\n \n{\n\n  \nstatic\n \nFuture\n \ninitializeApplication\n(\nApplicationOptions\n \noptions\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \n...\n \ndo\n \none\n \ntime\n \nsetup\n \n...\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \n...\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis method is invoked before any \nApplicationChannel\n instances are created. Any changes made to \noptions\n will be available in each \nApplicationChannel\n's \noptions\n property.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\nclass\n \nAppChannel\n \nextends\n \nApplicationChannel\n \n{\n\n\n  \nstatic\n \nFuture\n \ninitializeApplication\n(\nApplicationOptions\n \noptions\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n        \n    \noptions\n.\ncontext\n[\nspecial item\n]\n \n=\n \nxyz\n;\n\n  \n}\n  \n\n  \nFuture\n \nprepare\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nvar\n \nparsedConfigValues\n \n=\n \noptions\n.\ncontext\n[\nspecial item\n];\n \n// == xyz\n\n    \n...\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note the behavior of isolates as it relates to Aqueduct and the initialization process. Each isolate has its own heap. \ninitializeApplication\n is executed in the main isolate, whereas each \nApplicationChannel\n is instantiated in its own isolate. This means that any values stored in \nApplicationOptions\n must be safe to pass across isolates - i.e., they can't contain references to closures.\n\n\nAdditionally, any global variables or static properties that are set in the main isolate \nwill not be set\n in other isolates. Configuration types like \nCodecRegistry\n do not share values across isolates, because they use a static property to hold a reference to the repository of codecs. Therefore, they must be set up in \nApplicationChannel.prepare()\n.\n\n\nAlso, because static methods cannot be overridden in Dart, it is important that you ensure the name and signature of \ninitializeApplication\n exactly matches what is shown in these code samples. The analyzer can't help you here, unfortunately.\n\n\nApplication Channel File\n\n\nAn \nApplicationChannel\n subclass is most often declared in its own file named \nlib/channel.dart\n. This file must be exported from the application library file. For example, if the application is named \nwildfire\n, the application library file is \nlib/wildfire.dart\n. Here is a sample directory structure:\n\n\nwildfire/\n  lib/\n    wildfire.dart\n    channel.dart\n    controllers/\n      user_controller.dart      \n    ...\n\n\n\n\n\nSee \nthis guide\n for more details on how an Aqueduct application's files are structured.\n\n\nLazy Services\n\n\nMany service objects will establish a persistent network connection. A network connection can sometimes be interrupted and have to re-establish itself. If these connections are only opened when the application first starts, the application will not be able to reopen these connections without restarting the application. This would be very bad.\n\n\nFor that reason, services should manage their own connectivity behavior. For example, a database connection should connect it when it is asked to execute a query. If it already has a valid connection, it will go ahead and execute the query. Otherwise, it will establish the connection and then execute the query. The caller doesn't care - it gets a \nFuture\n with the desired result.\n\n\nThe pseudo-code looks something like this:\n\n\nFuture\n \nexecute\n(\nString\n \nsql\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n  \nif\n \n(\nconnection\n \n==\n \nnull\n \n||\n \n!\nconnection\n.\nisAvailable\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nconnection\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nConnection\n(...);\n\n    \nawait\n \nconnection\n.\nopen\n();\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \nreturn\n \nconnection\n.\nexecuteSQL\n(\nsql\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Application Object\n\n\nHidden in all of this discussion is the \nApplication\nT\n object. Because the \naqueduct serve\n command manages creating an \nApplication\nT\n instance, your code rarely concerns itself with this type.\n\n\nAn \nApplication\nT\n is the top-level object in an Aqueduct application; it sets up HTTP listeners and directs requests to \nApplicationChannel\ns. The \nApplication\nT\n itself is just a generic container for \nApplicationChannel\ns; it doesn't do much other than kick everything off.\n\n\nThe application's \nstart\n method will initialize at least one instance of the application's \nApplicationChannel\n. If something goes wrong during this initialization process, the application will throw an exception and halt starting the server. For example, setting up an invalid route in a \nApplicationChannel\n subclass would trigger this type of startup exception.\n\n\nAn \nApplication\nT\n has a number of options that determine how it will listen for HTTP requests, such as which port it is listening on or the SSL certificate it will use. These values are available in the channel's \noptions\n property, an instance of \nApplicationOptions\n.",

In general, there are two types of controllers:   Endpoint controllers fulfill a request (e.g., insert a row into a database and send a 200 OK response).  Middleware controllers verify something about a request (e.g., verifying the Authorization header has valid credentials) or modify the response created by an endpoint controller (e.g., add a response header).   Controllers are linked together - starting with zero or more middleware and ending with an endpoint controller - to form a series of steps a request will go through. Every controller can either pass the request on to its linked controller, or respond to the request itself (in which case, the linked controller never sees the request). For example, an authorizer middleware will let a request pass if it has valid credentials, but will respond with a 401 Unauthorized response if the credentials are invalid. Some controllers, like  Router , can have multiple controllers linked to it.  These linked controllers are called  channels . You create and link channels in a subclass of  ApplicationChannel .

A request is first handled by the  Router , and if its path matches '/users', it will be sent to an  Authorizer . If the  Authorizer  verifies the request, the request is passed to a  UserController  for fulfillment.  By contrast, if the request's path doesn't match '/users', the  Router  sends a 404 Not Found response and doesn't pass it to the  Authorizer . Likewise, if the request isn't authorized, the  Authorizer  will send a 401 Unauthorized response and prevent it from being passed to the  UserController . In other words, a request 'falls out' of the channel once a controller responds to it, so that no further controllers will receive it.   Linking Controllers  The  link()  method takes a closure that creates a new controller. Some controllers get instantiated for each request, and others get reused for every request.

            "text": "Configuring an Aqueduct Application\n\n\nThis guide covers configuring an Aqueduct application.\n\n\nConfiguration Files\n\n\nAqueduct applications use YAML configuration files to provide environment-specific values like database connection information. Use separate configuration files for testing and different deployment environments.\n\n\nThe path of a configuration file is available to an \nApplicationChannel\n through its \noptions\n property.\n\n\nclass\n \nTodoAppChannel\n \nextends\n \nApplicationChannel\n \n{\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nFuture\n \nprepare\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nvar\n \nconfig\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nTodoConfiguration\n(\noptions\n.\nconfigurationFilePath\n);\n\n    \n...\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default value is \nconfig.yaml\n.\n\n\nThe best practice for reading a configuration file is to subclass \nConfiguration\n. A \nConfiguration\n declares a property for each key in a configuration file. For example, see the following \nConfiguration\n subclass:\n\n\nclass\n \nTodoConfiguration\n \nextends\n \nConfiguration\n \n{\n\n  \nTodoConfiguration\n(\nString\n \nfileName\n)\n \n:\n \nsuper\n.\nfromFile\n(\nfileName\n);\n\n\n  \nDatabaseConnectionConfiguration\n \ndatabase\n;\n\n  \nString\n \napiBaseURL\n;\n\n\n  \n@\noptionalConfiguration\n\n  \nint\n \nidentifier\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis would read a YAML file like this:\n\n\ndatabase\n:\n\n  \nusername\n:\n \nfred\n\n  \npassword\n:\n \nfredspassword\n\n  \nhost\n:\n \ndb\n.\nmyapp\n.\ncom\n\n  \nport\n:\n \n5432\n\n  \ndatabaseName\n:\n \nfredsdb\n\n\napiBaseURL\n:\n \n/\napi\n\n\nidentifier\n:\n \n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf required properties are omitted from the YAML file being read, application startup will fail and throw an informative error.\n\n\nYou may use \nConfiguration\ns to read values from environment variables. In \nconfig.yaml\n, use a \n$\n-prefixed environment variable name instead of a value:\n\n\ndatabase: $DATABASE_CONNECTION_URL\napiBaseURL: /api\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the environment variable \nDATABASE_CONNECTION_URL\n's value were \n\"postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/test\"\n, the value of \nTodoConfiguration.database\n will be that string at runtime. (Note that \nDatabaseConnectionConfiguration\n may either have a YAML object for each connection attribute, or a database connection string.)\n\n\nThe \nsafe_config package\n has instructions for more additional usages.\n\n\nConfiguration Conventions and Deployment Options\n\n\nAqueduct uses two configuration files for a project: \nconfig.yaml\n and \nconfig.src.yaml\n. The latter is the \nconfiguration source file\n. The configuration source file declares key-value pairs that will be used when running the application tests. Deployed instances use \nconfig.yaml\n.\n\n\nThis pattern is used for two reasons:\n\n\n\n\nIt is the template for the \nconfig.yaml\n that will be read on deployed applications, providing documentation for your application's configuration.\n\n\nIt has the configuration values used during testing to inject mock dependencies.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, a production API instance might have the following \nconfig.yaml\n file with connection info for a production database:\n\n\ndatabase\n:\n \npostgres\n://\napp_user\n:\n$\n%\n4\njlkn\n#\nan\n*\n@\nmOZkea2\n@\nsomedns\n.\nname\n.\ncom\n:\n5432\n/\nproduction_db\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhereas \nconfig.src.yaml\n would have connection info for a local, test database:\n\n\ndatabase\n:\n \npostgres\n://\ntest\n:\ntest\n@\nlocalhost\n:\n5432\n/\ntemporary_db\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe source configuration file should be checked into version control. Whether or not \nconfig.yaml\n is checked in depends on how you are deploying your code. If you are using environment variables to control application configuration, you should check \nconfig.yaml\n into source control and provide \n$\n-prefixed environment variable values. If you are using managing configuration files on each deployed instance, do not check \nconfig.yaml\n into source control because it'll be a different file for each instance.\n\n\nIt can sometimes makes sense to have a \nlocal.yaml\n with values for running the application locally, e.g. when doing client testing. Use \n--config-path\n with \naqueduct serve\n to use a non-default name.\n\n\nPreventing Resource Leaks\n\n\nWhen an Aqueduct application starts, the application and its \nApplicationChannel\ns will likely create services that they use to respond to requests. In order for application tests to complete successfully, these services must be \"closed\" when the application stops. For built-in services, like \nPostgreSQLPersistentStore\n, this happens automatically when \nApplication.stop()\n is invoked.\n\n\nA \nServiceRegistry\n automatically stops registered services. Registration looks like this:\n\n\nvar\n \nconnection\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nConnectionOfSomeKind\n();\n\n\nawait\n \nconnection\n.\nopen\n();\n\n\nServiceRegistry\n.\ndefaultInstance\n\n  \n.\nregister\nConnectionOfSomeKind\n(\nconnection\n,\n \n(\nc\n)\n \n=\n \nc\n.\nclose\n());\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis method takes the service to be closed and a closure that closes it.

If the closure returns a \nFuture\n, \nServiceRegistry.close\n will not complete until the \nFuture\n completes. \nServiceRegistry.defaultInstance\n is closed in \nApplication.stop()\n, any registries created by the programmer must be closed manually.\n\n\nThe return type of \nServiceRegistry.register\n is the object being registered.

When a preflight request is received from a browser (an OPTIONS request with Access-Control-Request-Method header and Origin headers), the response is created by evaluating the policy of the \nController\n that will respond to the real request.\n\n\nIn practice, this means that the policy of the last controller in a channel is used. For example, the policy of \nFooController\n generates the preflight response:\n\n\nrouter\n\n  \n.\nroute\n(\n/foo\n)\n\n  \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nAuthorizer\n(...))\n\n  \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nFooController\n());\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery \nController\n has a \npolicy\n property (a \nCORSPolicy\n instance). The \npolicy\n has properties for configuring CORS options for that particular endpoint. By having a \npolicy\n, every \nController\n automatically implements logic to respond to preflight requests without any additional code.\n\n\nPolicies can be set at the controller level or at the application level. The static property \nCORSPolicy.defaultPolicy\n can be modified at initialization time to set the CORS options for every controller.\n\n\nclass\n \nMyApplicationChannel\n \nextends\n \nApplicationChannel\n \n{\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nFuture\n \nprepare\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nCORSPolicy\n.\ndefaultPolicy\n.\nallowedOrigins\n \n=\n \n[\nhttp://mywebsite.com/\n];\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default policy is very permissive: POST, PUT, DELETE and GET are allowed methods. All origins are valid (*).\n\n\nEach individual controller can override or replace the default policy by modifying its own \npolicy\n in its constructor.\n\n\nclass\n \nMyResourceController\n \nextends\n \nResourceController\n \n{\n\n  \nMyResourceController\n()\n \n{\n\n    \npolicy\n.\nallowedMethods\n \n=\n \n[\nPOST\n];\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring HTTPS\n\n\nBy default, an Aqueduct application does not use HTTPS. In many cases, an Aqueduct application sits behind an SSL-enabled load balancer or some other proxy. The traffic from the load balancer is sent to the Aqueduct application unencrypted over HTTP.\n\n\nHowever, Aqueduct may be configured to manage HTTPS connections itself. By passing the value private key and SSL certificate paths as options to \n--ssl-key-path\n \nand\n \n--ssl-certificate-path\n in \naqueduct serve\n, an Aqueduct application will configure itself to only allow HTTPS connections.\n\n\naqueduct serve --ssl-key-path server.key.pem --ssl-certificate-path server.cert.pem\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth the key and certificate file must be unencrypted PEM files, and both must be provided to this command. These files are typically issued by a \"Certificate Authority\", such as \nletsencrypt.org\n.\n\n\nWhen an application is started with these options, the \ncertificateFilePath\n and \nkeyFilePath\n are set on the \nApplicationOptions\n your application is being run with. (If you are not using \naqueduct serve\n, you can set these values directly when instantiating \nApplicationOptions\n.)\n\n\nFor more granular control over setting up an HTTPS server, you may override \nsecurityContext\n in \nApplicationChannel\n. By default, this property will create a \nSecurityContext\n from the \ncertificateFilePath\n and \nkeyFilePath\n in the channels's \noptions\n. A \nSecurityContext\n allows for password-encrypted credential files, configuring client certificates and other less used HTTPS schemes.\n\n\nclass\n \nMyApplicationChannel\n \nextends\n \nApplicationChannel\n \n{\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nSecurityContext\n \nget\n \nsecurityContext\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \nnew\n \nSecurityContext\n()\n\n      \n..\nusePrivateKey\n(\nserver.key\n,\n \npassword:\n \n1234\n)\n\n      \n..\nuseCertificateChain\n(\nserver.crt\n,\n \npassword:\n \n1234\n);\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}",

This pattern is used for two reasons:   It is the template for the  config.yaml  that will be read on deployed applications, providing documentation for your application's configuration.  It has the configuration values used during testing to inject mock dependencies.   For example, a production API instance might have the following  config.yaml  file with connection info for a production database:  database :   postgres :// app_user : $ % 4 jlkn # an * @ mOZkea2 @ somedns . name . com : 5432 / production_db   Whereas  config.src.yaml  would have connection info for a local, test database:  database :   postgres :// test : test @ localhost : 5432 / temporary_db   The source configuration file should be checked into version control. Whether or not  config.yaml  is checked in depends on how you are deploying your code.

The  Request  is added to a  ApplicationChannel , sending it through the channel of  Controller s until it is responded to.  In rare circumstances, you may choose to remove a  Request  from the application channel and manipulate the request with  dart:io  only. Once removed, it is your responsibility to respond to the request by setting properties on and closing the  HttpRequest.response . To take a request out of the channel, simply return  null  from a  Controller :  @ override  Controller   get   entryPoint   { \n   final   router   =   new   Router (); \n\n   router \n     . route ( /bypass_aqueduct ) \n     . linkFunction (( req )   async   { \n       req . response . statusCode   =   200 ; \n       req . response . close (); \n\n       return   null ; \n     }); \n\n   return   router ;  }   This technique is valuable when Aqueduct can't do something you want it to do or when using  websockets .",

            "text": "Multi-threading in Aqueduct\n\n\nOne of the primary differentiators between Aqueduct and other server frameworks is its multi-threaded behavior. When an Aqueduct application starts, it replicates the application logic across a number of threads.\n\n\nIn Dart, threads are called \nisolates\n. The difference in naming isn't just to be cute - an isolate is a little bit different than a thread in that memory is not shared between isolates. Each isolate has its own heap (this is where memory for objects is allocated from) that other isolates can't access.\n\n\nAn isolated thread is very valuable. Many multi-threaded applications share memory across threads, which require difficult design patterns and can easily introduce hard to track bugs that even the most experienced programmer will have a hard time avoiding.\n\n\nHow Aqueduct Uses Isolates\n\n\nAn application is initialized by invoking a series of initialization methods in a \nApplicationChannel\n. Once these methods are finished executing, the application starts sending HTTP requests through the channel created by the \nApplicationChannel\n.\n\n\nBecause an \nApplicationChannel\n is a type - and can be instantiated - Aqueduct simply creates a number of isolates and instantiates \nApplicationChannel\n for each. The initialization code is therefore identical for each isolate, which means that the ongoing behavior of each isolate is also identical.\n\n\nMore importantly, you - the programmer - have to do absolutely nothing to take advantage of Aqueduct's multi-threaded behavior. You simply have to pick the number of isolates you want to run the application on (see \nthis section\n).\n\n\nWhile you don't have to do anything in an Aqueduct application to take advantage of multiple processors, there are things you shouldn't do or should do in another way.\n\n\nFirst, you must be careful of keeping any state in your application. After initialization, any objects created while handling a request should be destroyed once the request is fulfilled. Any data that needs to be persisted must be stored in a database or other data store. This is just good practice for a REST API anyhow, so nothing is really lost here.\n\n\nHowever, there are times where you do need to track state. For example, if you are managing websocket connections, you do need to store some state after initialization - a reference to the websocket. \nThis guide\n covers this topic in detail; the simple explanation is to use the \nApplicationMessageHub\n.\n\n\nAnother thing that is important to consider is initialization. The methods \nprepare()\n and \nentryPoint\n in an application channel will be invoked on each isolate. This behavior is guaranteed to occur for each isolate and there is often little to worry about.\n\n\nHowever, when implementing \nApplicationChannel.initializeApplication\n, code runs on the main isolate. Any changes to static variables or singletons will not be replicated to the isolates running the application logic. The use case for this method is rather minimal, but it is very important that types like \nCodecRegistry\n aren't configured in this method.\n\n\nHow Many Isolates Should I Use\n\n\nTo give you a starting point, the default number of isolates for an application is 3 when started with \naqueduct serve\n. While less than 3 isolates will most certainly degrade performance, more than 3 doesn't necessarily improve performance. (And many more will certainly degrade performance.)\n\n\nThere are a number of variables that factor into the isolate count decision. First, recall a computer essentially does two things: it executes instructions and transmits data. Both of these tasks take time, especially when that data is transmitted to another computer thousands of miles away. (It is a modern marvel that these tasks occur as fast as they do - one that we often take for granted.)\n\n\nWhile a few milliseconds difference in speed to handle a single request isn't all that meaningful, when you start receiving thousands of requests at a time, these milliseconds add up. When your application is struggling to keep up with executing instructions, it is said to be \nCPU-bound\n. (When your application is struggling to transmit data, it is said to be \nIO-bound\n.)\n\n\nA CPU-bound application has two choices: execute less instructions or have more processors (or cores) to execute instructions with. Most computers these days have multiple processors. When only using a single isolate, an Aqueduct application can only use one of those processors at a time. As the number of isolates increases, so too do the number of processors that can be used at a time.\n\n\nThus, more isolates means more processors means more instructions and your application bound less by the CPU. However, there is a limit - creating 100 isolates when there are only two processors doesn't yield any greater performance, because 50 isolates will fight over a single processor. In fact, the amount of work to schedule these instructions and the amount of memory this many isolates will consume will hurt performance.\n\n\nFor example, when running benchmarks with \nwrk\n on my four-core machine, I get significantly better results as I add isolates 1 through 4, but then I get marginal gains and finally less or equal performance as I increase the number of isolates past 4. The blue bar represents the number of requests per second for each isolate count when making a simple HTTP call to Aqueduct.\n\n\n\n\n(Note that benchmarks are a good way of measuring relative performance of an application and identifying bottlenecks, but real world usability performance across a network is the only measurement that matters. The absolute value of these benchmarks should not be taken seriously, as they entirely remove the network portion of the transmission.)\n\n\nBut this isn't the whole story. Server applications are rarely CPU-bound, but instead IO-bound. The red bar represents the number of requests per second when making a database query and returning the results of that query as JSON in the response body. When using Observatory, the measurements indicate that the overwhelming majority of the time is spent transmitting data to and from the database. This is an example of being bound by IO (and the speed of the query).\n\n\nRecall that each isolate has its own database connection. A database connection is a serial queue - it can only handle one query at a time. Increasing the number of database connections means handling more queries at a time. This is no more apparent than when looking at the following graph, which measures the latency of requests with and without a database call.\n\n\n\n\nWhen there is only one database connection (one isolate), the latency is significantly higher per request - the application is entirely bound by the speed of the database serial queue. Adding a second isolate, and therefore a second database connection, drops the latency by more than half.\n\n\nThere are diminishing returns as more database connections are added. That's because the same thing about the number of threads per processor also applies to the number of database connections. Adding more database connections doesn't magically make the database server run any faster.\n\n\nAs a general rule, start with N-1 isolates, where N is the number of processors on the machine. Use \nwrk\n and Observatory to profile your application and tune accordingly. In a multi-instance environment, remember that the total number of database connections is MxN, where M is the number of machines and N is the number of isolates.\n\n\nIf you find yourself in a jam where IO would be better served by less isolates, but CPU would be better served by more isolates, you may consider using a database connection pool isolate.",

For every HTTP request an application receives, an instance of \nRequest\n is created. A \nResponse\n must be created for each \nRequest\n. Requests pass through a channel of \nControllers\n to be validated, modified and finally responded to.\n\n\nThe Request Object\n\n\nAn instance of \nRequest\n represents an HTTP request and are automatically created when the application receives a request. A \nRequest\n is a wrapper around the Dart standard library \nHttpRequest\n and its values - such as its URI or headers - can be accessed through its \nraw\n property.\n\n\nA \nRequest\n has a \nbody\n property. This property decodes the body contents into Dart objects based on the request's content type. The mechanism to decode the body is determined by \nCodecRegistry\n, which is covered in more detail in a later section. By default, decoders exist for text, JSON and form data. The size of a request body is limited to 10MB by default and can be changed by setting the value of \nRequestBody.maxSize\n during application initialization.\n\n\nA \nRequest\n is handled by one or more \nController\ns before to be responded to. \nController\ns may validate or add more information to the request, so that later controllers can use this information. For example, an \nAuthorizer\n controller will validate the Authorization header of a request. Once validated, it will add authorization info to the request - like the authorized user ID - and pass it to the next controller. The next controller in the channel has access to the authorization info without having to perform another fetch.\n\n\nThese additional values are added to a \nRequest.attachments\n property. Subsequent controllers can access these values.\n\n\nclass\n \nAPIKeyController\n \nextends\n \nController\n \n{\n\n  \nAPIKeyController\n(\nthis\n.\napiService\n);\n\n\n  \nfinal\n \nAPIService\n \napiService\n;\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nFuture\nRequestOrResponse\n \nhandle\n(\nRequest\n \nrequest\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nfinal\n \napiKey\n \n=\n \nrequest\n.\nraw\n.\nheaders\n.\nvalue\n(\nx-api-key\n);\n\n    \nif\n \n(\napiKey\n \n==\n \nnull\n)\n \n{\n\n      \nreturn\n \nResponse\n.\nbadRequest\n(\nbody:\n \n{\nerror\n:\n \nmissing required header x-api-key\n});\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nrequest\n.\nattachments\n[\nclientId\n]\n \n=\n \nawait\n \napiService\n.\ngetClientId\n(\napiKey\n);\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nrequest\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA \nRequest\n also has two built-in attachments, \nauthorization\n and \npath\n. \nauthorization\n contains authorization information from an \nAuthorizer\n and \npath\n has request path information from a \nRouter\n.\n\n\nRequest\ns are responded to when a controller creates a \nResponse\n.\n\n\nThe Response Object\n\n\nAn instance of \nResponse\n represents the status code, headers and body of an HTTP response. \nResponse\n objects are returned from controller methods like \nhandle\n or a \nResourceController operation method\n. Aqueduct sends the contents of a response returned from a controller to the requesting HTTP client. The default constructor takes a status code, header map and body object. There are many named constructors for common response types:\n\n\nResponse\n(\n200\n,\n \n{\nx-header\n:\n \nvalue\n},\n \nbody:\n \n[\n1\n,\n \n2\n,\n \n3\n]);\n\n\nResponse\n.\nok\n({\nkey\n:\n \nvalue\n});\n\n\nResponse\n.\ncreated\n();\n\n\nResponse\n.\nbadRequest\n(\nbody:\n \n{\nerror\n:\n \nreason\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA response can be modified after it is created by middleware controllers. Middleware controllers add \nresponse modifiers\n to a \nRequest\n; when the response is created for that request, the modifiers are ran in the order they were added.\n\n\nclass\n \nRequestIdentifyingController\n \nextends\n \nController\n \n{\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nFuture\nRequestOrResponse\n \nhandle\n(\nRequest\n \nrequest\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \n// Invoked after another controller in the channel creates a response\n\n    \nrequest\n.\naddResponseModifier\n((\nresp\n)\n \n{\n      \n      \nresp\n.\nheaders\n[\nx-request-id\n]\n \n=\n \ngenerateRequestId\n();\n\n    \n});\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nrequest\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeaders are encoded according to \ndart:io.HttpHeaders.add\n. For body encoding behavior, see the following sections.\n\n\nEncoding and Decoding the HTTP Body\n\n\nRequest\n and \nResponse\n objects have behavior for handling the HTTP body. You decode the contents of a \nRequest\n body into Dart objects that are used in your code. You provide a Dart object to a \nResponse\n and it is automatically encoded according to the content-type of the response.\n\n\nDecoding Request Bodies\n\n\nEvery \nRequest\n has a \nRequest.body\n property. This object decodes the bytestream from the request body into Dart objects, and caches that decoded object for subsequent access. The behavior for decoding is determined by the content-type header of the request (see the section on \nCodecRegistry\n later in this guide). When you decode a body, you can specify the Dart object type you expect it to be. If the decoded body object is not the expected type, an exception that sends a 400 Bad Request error is thrown.\n\n\n// Ensures that the decoded body is a Map\nString, dynamic\n\n\nfinal\n \nmap\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nrequest\n.\nbody\n.\ndecode\nMap\nString\n,\n \ndynamic\n();\n\n\n\n// Takes whatever object the body is decoded into\n\n\nfinal\n \nanyObject\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nrequest\n.\nbody\n.\ndecode\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce a request's body has been decoded, it can be accessed through a synchronous \nas\n method. This method also takes a type argument to enforce the type of the decoded body object.\n\n\nfinal\n \nmap\n \n=\n \nrequest\n.\nbody\n.\nas\nMap\nString\n,\n \ndynamic\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInferred Types\n\n\nYou don't need to provide a type argument to \nas\n or \ndecode\n if the type can be inferred. For example, \nManagedObject.readFromMap(await request.body.decode())\n will infer the type of the decoded body as a \nMap\nString, dynamic\n without having to provide type parameters.\n\n\n\n\nIf a body cannot be decoded according to its content-type (the data is malformed), an error is thrown that sends the appropriate error response to the client. By default, the maximum size of a request body is 10MB (see \nRequestBody.maxSize\n).\n\n\nFor more request body behavior, see the API reference for \nRequestBody\n, the \nsection on body binding for ResourceControllers\n and a later section in this guide on \nSerializable\n.\n\n\nEncoding Response Body Objects\n\n\nAn HTTP response often contains a \nbody\n. For example, the body in response to \nGET /users/1\n might be JSON object that represents a user. To ensure the client understands that the body is a JSON object, it includes the header \nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\n.\n\n\nWhen creating a \nResponse\n that has a body, you provide a \nbody object\n and a \ncontentType\n. For example:\n\n\nvar\n \nmap\n \n=\n \n{\nkey\n:\n \nvalue\n};\n\n\n\n// ContentType.json is the default, setting it may be omitted.\n\n\n// ContentType.json == `application/json; charset=utf-8\n\n\nfinal\n \nresponse\n \n=\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\nmap\n)\n\n  \n..\ncontentType\n \n=\n \nContentType\n.\njson\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBody objects are encoded according to their content-type. In the above, \nmap\n is first encoded as a JSON string and then to a list of UTF8 bytes.\n\n\n\n\nA \nContentType\n is made up of three components: a primary type, a subtype and an optional character set.\n\n\n\n\nThe primary and subtype determine the first conversion step and the charset determines the next. Each step is performed by an instance of \nCodec\n (from \ndart:convert\n). For example, the content type \napplication/json\n selects \nJsonCodec\n, while charset \nutf-8\n selects \nUtf8Codec\n. These two codecs are run in succession to convert the \nMap\n to a list of bytes. The codec is selected by your application's \nCodecRegistry\n; this is covered in later section.\n\n\nThe body object must be a valid input for the selected codec. In the above example, a \nMap\nString, dynamic\n can be encoded by a \nJsonCodec\n. But if the body object was something silly - like an \nController\n - encoding would fail at runtime and the client would be sent a 500 Server Error response. A valid input for one \nCodec\n may not be valid for another; it is up to you to ensure that the body object is valid for the \ncontentType\n of the response.\n\n\nNot all content types require two conversion steps. For example, when serving an HTML file, the body object is already an HTML \nString\n. It will only be converted by a charset encoder:\n\n\nvar\n \nhtml\n \n=\n \nhtml\n/html\n;\n\n\nvar\n \nresponse\n \n=\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\nhtml\n)\n\n  \n..\ncontentType\n \n=\n \nContentType\n.\nhtml\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd an image body object needs no conversion at all, since it is already a list of bytes. If there is no registered codec for a content-type, the body object must be a byte array (\nList\nint\n where each value is between 0-255).\n\n\nfinal\n \nimageFile\n \n=\n \nFile\n(\nimage.jpg\n);\n\n\nfinal\n \nimageBytes\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nimageFile\n.\nreadAsBytes\n();\n\n\nfinal\n \nresponse\n \n=\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\nimageBytes\n)\n\n  \n..\ncontentType\n \n=\n \nContentType\n(\nimage\n,\n \njpeg\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may disable the automatic encoding of a body as long as the body object is a byte array:\n\n\nfinal\n \njsonBytes\n \n=\n \nutf8\n.\nencode\n(\njson\n.\nencode\n({\nkey\n:\n \nvalue\n}));\n\n\nfinal\n \nresponse\n \n=\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\njsonBytes\n)..\nencodeBody\n \n=\n \nfalse\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee a later section for more details on content type to codec mappings. Also, see the documentation for \nCodecRegistry\n for details on built-in codecs and adding codecs.\n\n\nStreaming Response Bodies\n\n\nA body object may also be a \nStream\nT\n. \nStream\nT\n body objects are most often used when serving files. This allows the contents of the file to be streamed from disk to the HTTP client without having to load the whole file into memory first. (See also \nFileController\n.)\n\n\nfinal\n \nimageFile\n \n=\n \nFile\n(\nimage.jpg\n);\n\n\nfinal\n \nimageByteStream\n \n=\n \nimageFile\n.\nopenRead\n();\n\n\nfinal\n \nresponse\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\nimageByteStream\n)\n\n  \n..\ncontentType\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nContentType\n(\nimage\n,\n \njpeg\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a body object is a \nStream\nT\n, the response will not be sent until the stream is closed. For finite streams - like those from opened filed - this happens as soon as the entire file is read. For streams that you construct yourself, you must close the stream some time after the response has been returned.\n\n\nCodecs and Content Types\n\n\nIn the above sections, we glossed over how a codec gets selected when preparing the response body. The common case of \nManagedObject\nT\n body objects that are sent as UTF8 encoded JSON 'just works' and is suitable for most applications. When serving assets for a web application or different data formats like XML, it becomes important to understand how Aqueduct's codec registry works.\n\n\nCodecRegistry\n contains mappings from content types to \nCodec\ns. These codecs encode response bodies and decode request bodies. There are three built-in codecs for \napplication/json\n, \napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded\n and \ntext/*\n. When a response is being sent, the repository is searched for an entry that exactly matches the primary and subtype of the \nResponse.contentType\n. If an entry exists, the associated \nCodec\n starts the conversion. For example, if the content type is \napplication/json; charset=utf-8\n, the built-in \napplication/json\n codec encodes the body object.\n\n\nIf there isn't an exact match, but there is an entry for the primary type with the wildcard (\n*\n) subtype, that codec is used. For example, the built-in codec for \ntext/*\n will be selected for both \ntext/plain\n and \ntext/html\n. If there was something special that had to be done for \ntext/html\n, a more specific codec may be added for that type:\n\n\nclass\n \nMyChannel\n \nextends\n \nApplicationChannel\n \n{\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nFuture\n \nprepare\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nCodecRegistry\n.\ndefaultInstance\n.\nadd\n(\nContentType\n(\napplication\n,\n \nhtml\n),\n \nHTMLCodec\n());\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodecs must be added in your \nApplicationChannel.prepare\n method. The codec must implement \nCodec\n from \ndart:convert\n. In the above example, when a response's content type is \ntext/html\n, the \nHTMLCodec\n will encode the body object. This codec takes precedence over \ntext/*\n because it is more specific.\n\n\nWhen selecting a codec for a response body, the \nContentType.charset\n doesn't impact which codec is selected. If a response's content-type has a charset, then a charset encoder like \nUTF8\n will be applied as a last encoding step. For example, a response with content-type \napplication/json; charset=utf-8\n will encode the body object as a JSON string, which is then encoded as a list of UTF8 bytes. It is required that a response body's eventually encoded type is a list of bytes, so it follows that a codec that produces a string must have a charset.\n\n\nIf there is no codec in the repository for the content type of a \nResponse\n, the body object must be a \nList\nint\n or \nStream\nList\nint\n. If you find yourself converting data prior to setting it as a body object, it may make sense to add your own codec to \nCodecRegistry\n.\n\n\nA request's body always starts as a list of bytes and is decoded into Dart objects. To decode a JSON request body, it first must be decoded from the list of UTF8 bytes into a string. It is possible that a client could omit the charset in its content-type header. Codecs added to \nCodecRegistry\n may specify a default charset to interpret a charset-less content-type. When a codec is added to the repository, if content-type's charset is non-null, that is the default. For example, the JSON codec is added like this:\n\n\nCodecRegistry\n.\ndefaultInstance\n.\nadd\n(\n\n  \nContentType\n(\napplication\n,\n \njson\n,\n \ncharset:\n \nutf-8\n),\n\n  \nconst\n \nJsonCodec\n(),\n\n  \nallowCompression:\n \ntrue\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf no charset is specified when registering a codec, no charset decoding occurs on a request body if one doesn't exist. Content-types that are decoded from a \nString\n should not use a default charset because the repository would always attempt to decode the body as a string first.\n\n\nCompression with gzip\n\n\nBody objects may be compressed with \ngzip\n if the HTTP client allows it \nand\n the \nCodecRegistry\n has been configured to compress the content type of the response. The three built-in codecs - \napplication/json\n, \napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded\n and \ntext/*\n - are all configured to allow compression. Compression occurs as the last step of conversion and only if the HTTP client sends the \nAccept-Encoding: gzip\n header.\n\n\nContent types that are not in the codec repository will not trigger compression, even if the HTTP client allows compression with the \nAccept-Encoding\n header. This is to prevent binary contents like images from being 'compressed', since they are likely already compressed by a content-specific algorithm. In order for Aqueduct to compress a content type other than the built-in types, you may add a codec to the repository with the \nallowCompression\n flag. (The default value is \ntrue\n.)\n\n\nCodecRegistry\n.\nadd\n(\n\n  \nContentType\n(\napplication\n,\n \nx-special\n),\n\n   \nMyCodec\n(),\n\n  \nallowCompression:\n \ntrue\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also set whether or not a content type uses compression without having to specify a codec if no conversion step needs to occur:\n\n\nCodecRegistry\n.\nsetAllowsCompression\n(\nnew\n \nContentType\n(\napplication\n,\n \nx-special\n),\n \ntrue\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSerializable Objects\n\n\nEncoding and decoding primarily takes or yields simple Dart objects like \nMap\n, \nList\n and \nString\n. It is often beneficial to add structure to body objects for use in your code. Classes that implement \nSerializable\n provide this structure. A \nSerializable\n object must implement a \nreadFromMap()\n and \nasMap()\n method to convert their structure into or from a Dart \nMap\n.\n\n\nAn object that extends \nSerializable\n may be used as a response body object directly:\n\n\nclass\n \nPerson\n \nextends\n \nSerializable\n \n{\n\n  \nString\n \nname\n;\n\n  \nString\n \nemail\n;\n\n\n  \nMap\nString\n,\n \ndynamic\n \nasMap\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \n{\n\n      \nname\n:\n \nname\n,\n\n      \nemail\n:\n \nemail\n\n    \n};\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \nvoid\n \nreadFromMap\n(\nMap\nString\n,\n \ndynamic\n \ninputMap\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nname\n \n=\n \ninputMap\n[\nname\n];\n\n    \nemail\n \n=\n \ninputMap\n[\nemail\n];\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nfinal\n \nperson\n \n=\n \nPerson\n();\n\n\nfinal\n \nresponse\n \n=\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\nperson\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen responding with a \nSerializable\n, its \nasMap()\n is called prior to any encoding by the codec registry. \nManagedObject\nT\n, part of the Aqueduct ORM, implements \nSerializable\n so results from \nQuery\nT\n may be body objects:\n\n\nfinal\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nPerson\n(\ncontext\n)..\nwhere\n((\np\n)\n \n=\n \np\n.\nid\n).\nequalTo\n(\n1\n);\n\n\nfinal\n \nperson\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nquery\n.\nfetchOne\n();\n\n\nfinal\n \nresponse\n \n=\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\nperson\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA response body object can also be a list of \nSerializable\n objects.\n\n\nfinal\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nPerson\n(\ncontext\n);\n\n\nfinal\n \npeople\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nquery\n.\nfetch\n();\n\n\nfinal\n \nresponse\n \n=\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\npeople\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe entire flow of a body object is shown in the following diagram. Each orange item is an allowed body object type and shows the steps it will go through when being encoded to the HTTP response body. For example, a \nSerializable\n goes through three steps, whereas a \nList\nint\n goes through zero steps and is added as-is to the HTTP response.\n\n\n\n\nA serializable object can be read from a request body:\n\n\nfinal\n \nperson\n \n=\n \nPerson\n()..\nreadFromMap\n(\nawait\n \nrequest\n.\nbody\n.\ndecode\n());\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSerializable objects are the only types of objects that can be \nbound to a ResourceController argument\n.\n\n\n@\nOperation\n.\npost\n()\n\n\nFuture\nResponse\n \naddPerson\n(\n@\nBind\n.\nbody\n()\n \nPerson\n \nperson\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n  \nfinal\n \ninsertedPerson\n \n=\n \nawait\n \ncontext\n.\ninsertObject\n(\nperson\n);\n\n  \nreturn\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\ninsertedPerson\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSerializable and OpenAPI Generation\n\n\nSee the section on how \nSerializable\n types work with OpenAPI documentation generation \nhere\n.\n\n\nExample: multipart/form-data\n\n\nAdd \npackage:mime\n to your \npubspec.yaml\n as a dependency.\n\n\ndependencies\n:\n\n  \nmime\n:\n \nany\n \n# prefer a better constraint than this\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then decode the body with the objects from that package:\n\n\nimport\n \npackage:aqueduct/aqueduct.dart\n;\n\n\nimport\n \npackage:mime/mime.dart\n;\n\n\n\nclass\n \nMyController\n \nextends\n \nResourceController\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nOperation\n.\npost\n()\n\n  \nFuture\nResponse\n \npostForm\n()\n \nasync\n \n{}\n\n    \nfinal\n \ntransformer\n \n=\n \nMimeMultipartTransformer\n(\nrequest\n.\nraw\n.\nheaders\n.\ncontentType\n.\nparameters\n[\nboundary\n]);\n\n    \nfinal\n \nbodyStream\n \n=\n \nStream\n.\nfromIterable\n([\nawait\n \nrequest\n.\nbody\n.\ndecode\nList\nint\n()]);\n\n    \nfinal\n \nparts\n \n=\n \nawait\n \ntransformer\n.\nbind\n(\nbodyStream\n).\ntoList\n();\n\n\n    \nfor\n \n(\nvar\n \npart\n \nin\n \nparts\n)\n \n{\n\n      \nfinal\n \nheaders\n \n=\n \npart\n.\nheaders\n;\n\n      \nfinal\n \ncontent\n \n=\n \nawait\n \npart\n.\ntoList\n();\n\n      \n...\n\n    \n}\n    \n  \n}\n\n\n}",

This property decodes the body contents into Dart objects based on the request's content type.

For example, an  Authorizer  controller will validate the Authorization header of a request. Once validated, it will add authorization info to the request - like the authorized user ID - and pass it to the next controller.

To ensure the client understands that the body is a JSON object, it includes the header  Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 .  When creating a  Response  that has a body, you provide a  body object  and a  contentType . For example:  var   map   =   { key :   value };  // ContentType.json is the default, setting it may be omitted.  // ContentType.json == `application/json; charset=utf-8  final   response   =   Response . ok ( map ) \n   .. contentType   =   ContentType . json ;   Body objects are encoded according to their content-type. In the above,  map  is first encoded as a JSON string and then to a list of UTF8 bytes.   A  ContentType  is made up of three components: a primary type, a subtype and an optional character set.   The primary and subtype determine the first conversion step and the charset determines the next. Each step is performed by an instance of  Codec  (from  dart:convert ). For example, the content type  application/json  selects  JsonCodec , while charset  utf-8  selects  Utf8Codec . These two codecs are run in succession to convert the  Map  to a list of bytes. The codec is selected by your application's  CodecRegistry ; this is covered in later section.  The body object must be a valid input for the selected codec. In the above example, a  Map String, dynamic  can be encoded by a  JsonCodec . But if the body object was something silly - like an  Controller  - encoding would fail at runtime and the client would be sent a 500 Server Error response. A valid input for one  Codec  may not be valid for another; it is up to you to ensure that the body object is valid for the  contentType  of the response.  Not all content types require two conversion steps. For example, when serving an HTML file, the body object is already an HTML  String . It will only be converted by a charset encoder:  var   html   =   html /html ;  var   response   =   Response . ok ( html ) \n   .. contentType   =   ContentType . html ;   And an image body object needs no conversion at all, since it is already a list of bytes.

For example, the JSON codec is added like this:  CodecRegistry . defaultInstance . add ( \n   ContentType ( application ,   json ,   charset:   utf-8 ), \n   const   JsonCodec (), \n   allowCompression:   true );   If no charset is specified when registering a codec, no charset decoding occurs on a request body if one doesn't exist. Content-types that are decoded from a  String  should not use a default charset because the repository would always attempt to decode the body as a string first.",

Classes that implement  Serializable  provide this structure. A  Serializable  object must implement a  readFromMap()  and  asMap()  method to convert their structure into or from a Dart  Map .  An object that extends  Serializable  may be used as a response body object directly:  class   Person   extends   Serializable   { \n   String   name ; \n   String   email ; \n\n   Map String ,   dynamic   asMap ()   { \n     return   { \n       name :   name , \n       email :   email \n     }; \n   } \n\n   void   readFromMap ( Map String ,   dynamic   inputMap )   { \n     name   =   inputMap [ name ]; \n     email   =   inputMap [ email ]; \n   }  }  final   person   =   Person ();  final   response   =   Response . ok ( person );   When responding with a  Serializable , its  asMap()  is called prior to any encoding by the codec registry.  ManagedObject T , part of the Aqueduct ORM, implements  Serializable  so results from  Query T  may be body objects:  final   query   =   Query Person ( context ).. where (( p )   =   p . id ). equalTo ( 1 );  final   person   =   await   query . fetchOne ();  final   response   =   Response . ok ( person );   A response body object can also be a list of  Serializable  objects.  final   query   =   Query Person ( context );  final   people   =   await   query . fetch ();  final   response   =   Response . ok ( people );   The entire flow of a body object is shown in the following diagram.

            "text": "Handling Requests: Fundamentals\n\n\nLearn how \nController\n objects are linked together to handle HTTP requests.\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nA controller is the basic building block of an Aqueduct application. A controller handles an HTTP request in some way. For example, a controller could return a 200 OK response with a JSON-encoded list of city names. A controller could also check a request to make sure it had the right credentials in its authorization header.\n\n\nControllers are linked together to compose their behaviors into a \nchannel\n. A channel handles a request by performing each of its controllers' behavior in order. For example, a channel with the aforementioned controllers would verify the credentials of a request and then returning a list of city names.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nController\n class provides the behavior for linking controllers together, and you subclass it to provide the logic for a particular controller behavior.\n\n\nLinking Controllers\n\n\nControllers are linked with their \nlink\n method. This method takes a closure that returns the next controller in the channel. The following shows a channel composed of two controllers:\n\n\nfinal\n \ncontrollerA\n \n=\n \nController\n();\n\n\ncontroller\n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nController\n());\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen \ncontrollerA\n handles a request, it can choose to respond to the request or let the request continue in the channel. When the request continues in this channel, the controller created by the closure passed to \nlink\n handles the request. Any number of controllers can be linked together in a channel, but the last controller must respond to the request. Controllers that always responder to request are called \nendpoint controllers\n, as opposed to \nmiddleware controllers\n that verify or modify the request and let the next controller in the channel handle it.\n\n\nLinking occurs in an \napplication channel\n, and is finalized during startup of your application (i.e., once you have set up your controllers, the cannot be changed once the application starts receiving requests). In a typical application, a \nRouter\n controller splits an application channel into multiple sub-channels.\n\n\nCreating Request Handling Behavior by Subclassing Controller\n\n\nEvery \nController\n implements its \nhandle\n method to handle a request. You override this method in your controllers to provide the logic for your application's controllers. The following is an example of an endpoint controller, because it always sends a response:\n\n\nclass\n \nNoteController\n \nextends\n \nController\n \n{\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nFuture\nRequestOrResponse\n \nhandle\n(\nRequest\n \nrequest\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nfinal\n \nnotes\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nfetchNotesFromDatabase\n();\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nnew\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\nnotes\n);\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis \nhandle\n method creates and returns a \nResponse\n object. When a \nhandle\n method returns a response, that response is sent to the client. Any linked controllers do not have their \nhandle\n method invoked; the request is removed from the channel.\n\n\nA middleware controller returns a response when the request is invalid. For example, an \nAuthorizer\n controller returns a \n401 Unauthorized\n response if the request's credentials are invalid (this removes the request from the channel). If a middleware controller deems the request acceptable, it returns the request from its \nhandle\n method. This signals to Aqueduct that the next controller in the channel should handle the request.\n\n\nAs an example, the pseudo-code for an \nAuthorizer\n looks like this:\n\n\nclass\n \nAuthorizer\n \nextends\n \nController\n \n{\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nFuture\nRequestOrResponse\n \nhandle\n(\nRequest\n \nrequest\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nif\n \n(\nisValid\n(\nrequest\n))\n \n{\n\n      \nreturn\n \nrequest\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nnew\n \nResponse\n.\nunauthorized\n();\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEndpoint Controllers\n\n\nIn most cases, endpoint controllers are created by subclassing \nResourceController\n. This controller allows you to declare more than one handler method in a controller to better organize logic. For example, one method might handle POST requests, while another handles GET requests.\n\n\n\n\nModifying a Response with Middleware\n\n\nA middleware controller can add a \nresponse modifier\n to a request. When an endpoint controller eventually creates a response, these modifiers are applied to the response before it is sent. Modifiers are added by invoking \naddResponseModifier\n on a request.\n\n\nclass\n \nVersioner\n \nextends\n \nController\n \n{\n\n  \nFuture\nRequestOrResponse\n \nhandle\n(\nRequest\n \nrequest\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nrequest\n.\naddResponseModifier\n((\nresponse\n)\n \n{\n\n      \nresponse\n.\nheaders\n[\nx-api-version\n]\n \n=\n \n2.1\n;\n\n    \n});\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nrequest\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny number of controllers can add a response modifier to a request; they will be processed in the order that they were added. Response modifiers are applied before the response body is encoded, allowing the body object to be manipulated. Response modifiers are invoked regardless of the response generated by the endpoint controller. If an uncaught error is thrown while adding response modifiers, any remaining response modifiers are not called and a 500 Server Error response is sent.\n\n\nLinking Functions\n\n\nFor simple behavior, functions with the same signature as \nhandle\n can be linked to controllers:\n\n\n  \nrouter\n\n    \n.\nroute\n(\n/path\n)\n\n    \n.\nlinkFunction\n((\nreq\n)\n \nasync\n \n=\n \nreq\n);\n\n    \n.\nlinkFunction\n((\nreq\n)\n \nasync\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\nnull\n));\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinking a function has all of the same behavior as \nController.handle\n: it can return a request or response, automatically handles exceptions, and can have controllers (and functions) linked to it.\n\n\nController Instantiation and Recycling\n\n\nIt is important to understand why \nlink\n takes a closure, instead of a controller object. Aqueduct is an object oriented framework. Objects have both state and behavior. An application will receive multiple requests that will be handled by the same type of controller. If a mutable controller object were reused to handle multiple requests, it could retain some of its state between requests. This would create problems that are difficult to debug.\n\n\nMost controllers are immutable - in other words, all of their properties are final and they have no setters. This (mostly) ensures that the controller won't change behavior between requests. When a controller is immutable, the \nlink\n closure is invoked once to create and link the controller object, and then the closure is discarded. The same controller object will be reused for every request.\n\n\nControllers can be mutable, with the caveat that they cannot be reused for multiple requests. For example, a \nResourceController\n can have properties that are bound to the values of a request, and therefore these properties will change and a new instance must be created for each request.\n\n\nA mutable \nController\n subclass must implement \nRecyclable\nT\n. The \nlink\n closure will be invoked for each request, creating a new instance of the recyclable controller to handle the request. If a controller has an expensive initialization process, the results of that initialization can be calculated once and reused for each controller instance by implementing the methods from \nRecyclable\nT\n.\n\n\nclass\n \nMyControllerState\n \n{\n\n  \ndynamic\n \nstuff\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nclass\n \nMyController\n \nextends\n \nController\n \nimplements\n \nRecyclable\nMyControllerState\n \n{\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nMyControllerState\n \nget\n \nrecycledState\n \n=\n \nexpensiveCalculation\n();\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nvoid\n \nrestore\n(\nMyControllerState\n \nstate\n)\n \n{\n\n    \n_restoredState\n \n=\n \nstate\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \nMyControllerState\n \n_restoredState\n;\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nFutureOr\nRequestOrResponse\n \nhandle\n(\nRequest\n \nrequest\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \n/* use _restoredState */\n\n    \nreturn\n \nnew\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(...);\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nrecycledState\n getter is called once, when the controller is first linked. Each new instance of a recyclable controller has its \nrestore\n method invoked prior to handling the request, and the data returned by \nrecycledState\n is passed as an argument. As an example, \nResourceController\n 'compiles' its operation methods. The compiled product is stored as recycled state so that future instances can bind request data more efficiently.\n\n\nException Handling\n\n\nIf an exception or error is thrown during the handling of a request, the controller currently handling the request will catch it. For the majority of values caught, a controller will send a 500 Server Response. The details of the exception or error will be \nlogged\n, and the request is removed from the channel (it will not be passed to a linked controller).\n\n\nThis is the default behavior for all thrown values except \nResponse\n and \nHandlerException\n.\n\n\nThrowing Responses\n\n\nA \nResponse\n can be thrown at any time; the controller handling the request will catch it and send it to the client. This completes the request. This might not seem useful, for example, the following shows a silly use of this behavior:\n\n\nclass\n \nThrower\n \nextends\n \nController\n \n{\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nFuture\nRequestOrResponse\n \nhandle\n(\nRequest\n \nrequest\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nif\n \n(\n!\nisForbidden\n(\nrequest\n))\n \n{\n\n      \nthrow\n \nnew\n \nResponse\n.\nforbidden\n();\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nnew\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\nnull\n);\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it can be valuable to send error responses from elsewhere in code as an application's codebase becomes more layered.\n\n\nThrowing HandlerExceptions\n\n\nExceptions can implement \nHandlerException\n to provide a response other than the default when thrown. For example, an application that handles bank transactions might declare an exception for invalid withdrawals:\n\n\nenum\n \nWithdrawalProblem\n \n{\n\n  \ninsufficientFunds\n,\n\n  \nbankClosed\n\n\n}\n\n\nclass\n \nWithdrawalException\n \nimplements\n \nException\n \n{\n\n  \nWithdrawalException\n(\nthis\n.\nproblem\n);\n\n\n  \nfinal\n \nWithdrawalProblem\n \nproblem\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nController code can catch this exception to return a different status code depending on the exact problem with a withdrawal. If this code has to be written in multiple places, it is useful for \nWithdrawalException\n to implement \nHandlerException\n. An implementor must provide an implementation for \nresponse\n:\n\n\nclass\n \nWithdrawalException\n \nimplements\n \nHandlerException\n \n{\n\n  \nWithdrawalException\n(\nthis\n.\nproblem\n);\n\n\n  \nfinal\n \nWithdrawalProblem\n \nproblem\n;\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nResponse\n \nget\n \nresponse\n \n{\n\n    \nswitch\n \n(\nproblem\n)\n \n{\n\n      \ncase\n \nWithdrawalProblem\n.\ninsufficientFunds:\n\n        \nreturn\n \nnew\n \nResponse\n.\nbadRequest\n(\nbody:\n \n{\nerror\n:\n \ninsufficient_funds\n});\n\n      \ncase\n \nWithdrawalProblem\n.\nbankClosed:\n\n        \nreturn\n \nnew\n \nResponse\n.\nbadRequest\n(\nbody:\n \n{\nerror\n:\n \nbank_closed\n});\n\n    \n}\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Aqueduct ORM exceptions (\nQueryException\n) implement \nHandlerException\n to return a response that best represents the ORM exception. For example, if a unique constraint is violated by a query, the thrown exception implements \nresponse\n to return a 409 Conflict response.\n\n\nCORS Headers and Preflight Requests\n\n\nController\ns have built-in behavior for handling CORS requests. They will automatically respond to \nOPTIONS\n preflight requests and attach CORS headers to any other response. See \nthe chapter on CORS\n for more details.",

Each new instance of a recyclable controller has its  restore  method invoked prior to handling the request, and the data returned by  recycledState  is passed as an argument. As an example,  ResourceController  'compiles' its operation methods. The compiled product is stored as recycled state so that future instances can bind request data more efficiently.",

            "text": "Routing\n\n\nWhat is routing?\n\n\nEvery HTTP request has a URL. A URL identifies a \nresource\n. In the early days of the Internet, a resource was a file. For example, the URL \nhttp://www.geocities.com/my_page/image.jpg\n would return the file \nimage.jpg\n from the folder \nmy_page\n on the webserver located at \nwww.geocities.com\n. In a web application today, resources come from many other sources of data, like a database or a connected device. The job of a web application is to provide, create or modify a resource for a URL, wherever that resource might come from.\n\n\nA URL is made up of many parts, some of which are optional. The typical URL we see as humans looks like this: \nhttp://stablekernel.com/about\n. Most people recognize that typing this URL into a browser would take them to our company's \"About\" page. In other words, our \"About\" page is a resource and the URL identifies it.\n\n\nMore generally, the \"About\" page URL has the three required components of a URL: a \nscheme\n (\nhttp\n), a \nhost\n (\nstablekernel.com\n) and a \npath\n (\n/about\n). The host specifies the computer responsible for providing the resource, the path identifies the resource and the scheme lets both the requester and the host know how they should exchange information.\n\n\nAn Aqueduct application receives requests when the scheme is \nhttp\n (or \nhttps\n) and the host refers to a machine where the application is running. Therefore, once the application gets the request, it only cares about the remaining component: the path.\n\n\nIn Aqueduct, a \nRouter\n routes \nRequest\ns to a \nController\n based on the request path. This process is known as \nrouting\n. When an application starts up, routes are registered in a subclass of \nApplicationChannel\n. Each registered route creates a new \nchannel\n of \nController\ns that will handle the request.\n\n\nRoute Specifications Match HTTP Request Paths\n\n\nA route is registered by invoking \nRouter.route\n. This method takes a \nroute specification\n - a \nString\n with some syntax rules that will match the path of a request. This registration occurs when an application first starts by overriding \nApplicationChannel.entryPoint\n. For example:\n\n\nclass\n \nMyApplicationChannel\n \nextends\n \nApplicationChannel\n \n{\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nController\n \nget\n \nentryPoint\n \n{\n\n    \nfinal\n \nrouter\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nRouter\n();\n\n\n    \nrouter\n\n      \n.\nroute\n(\n/users\n)\n\n      \n.\nlinkFunction\n((\nreq\n)\n \nasync\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\nawait\n \ngetAllUsers\n());\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nrouter\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe argument to \nroute\n is the route specification string. This particular route matches the path \n/users\n. That is, a request for the URL \nhttp://myserver.com/users\n will be handled by the \nlinkFunction\n closure. (Leading and trailing slashes are stripped out when routes are compiled, so including them has no effect, but it is good style to show a leading slash.)\n\n\nA path can have multiple segments (the characters between slashes). For example, the path \n/users/foo\n has two path segments: \nusers\n and \nfoo\n. A route specification matches each segment of a path against each of its segments. The path and the route must also have the same number of segments. Thus, the route specification \n/users/foo\n would match the path \n/users/foo\n, but it would not match the paths \n/users\n, \n/users/7\n or \n/users/foo/1\n.\n\n\nPath Variables\n\n\nA route specification may have \npath variables\n. A path variable captures the value from a path segment, so that your code can use it. A path variable is most often used to uniquely identify a resource by some identifier, like \n/users/1\n and \n/users/2\n.\n\n\nIn a route specification, a path variable starts with a colon (\n:\n). The name of the variable follows this colon. For example, consider the following route that declares a path variable named \nuserID\n:\n\n\nrouter\n.\nroute\n(\n/users/:userID\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis route specification will match \n/users/1\n, \n/users/2\n, \n/users/foo\n, etc. The value of \nuserID\n is \n1\n, \n2\n and \nfoo\n, respectively. This route won't match \n/users\n or \n/users/1/2\n.\n\n\nOptional Path Segments\n\n\nRoutes may have optional path segments. This allows a group of routes that all refer to a resource collection and its individual resources to go to the same controller. For example, the requests \n/users\n and \n/users/1\n can both be covered by a single route specification.\n\n\nAn optional path segment has square brackets (\n[]\n) around it. The brackets can go before or after slashes. For example, the following two syntaxes register a route that accepts both \n/users\n and \n/users/:userID\n:\n\n\nroute\n(\n/users/[:userID]\n)\n\n\nroute\n(\n/users[/:userID]\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConceptually, a request with a path of \n/users/1\n identifies a single user, where \n/users\n identifies all users. Optional segments are used to create better code structure by forwarding requests that deal with a specific type of resource to the same controller. Therefore, the code to handle one user or multiple users is written in the same place.\n\n\nYou may have any number of optional segments in a route specification. Each optional segment must be nested. The following route would match \n/a\n, \n/a/b\n and \n/a/b/c\n. It would not match \n/a/c\n.\n\n\nroute\n(\n/a/[b/[c]]\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's pretty rare to have more than one optional segment in a route. For example, consider the route:\n\n\nroute\n(\n/users/[:id/[:subresource/[:subresourceid]]]\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to handle one or more users is likely very different than the code to handle one of its subresources - different database tables will be queried and different authorization may be needed. Thus, a better approach is to split subresources into their own routes to keep controller logic modular:\n\n\n// Matches /users and /users/:id\n\n\nroute\n(\n/users/[:id]\n)...;\n\n\n\n// Matches /users/:userId/posts and /users/:userId/posts/:postId\n\n\nroute\n(\n/users/:userId/posts/[:postId]\n)...;\n\n\n\n// Matches /users/:userId/posts and /users/:userId/notes/:noteId\n\n\nroute\n(\n/users/:userId/notes/[:noteId]\n)...;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestricting Path Variable Values\n\n\nPath variables may restrict their possible values with a regular expression. The expression comes in parentheses following the path variable name. For example, the following route specification limits \nuserID\n to numbers only:\n\n\nroute\n(\n/users/:userID([0-9]+)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis regular expression would only apply to the \n:userID\n segment. Note that capture groups and parentheses in general can't be included in a route's regular expression.\n\n\nEverything in between the parentheses is evaluated as the regular expression. Therefore, any additional spaces or characters will be a part of the regular expression. Since spaces aren't valid in a URL, you don't want spaces in a regular expression.\n\n\nMatching the Remaining Path\n\n\nFinally, a route specification may have a special 'match-all' token, the asterisk (\n*\n). This token allows for any remaining request path to be matched, regardless of its contents or length. For example, the route specification \n/users/*\n would match the following paths:\n\n\n/users\n/users/1\n/users/foo\n/users/foo/bar\n/users/foo/bar/something/else/and/this/goes/on/forever\n\n\n\n\n\nThis token is used when another medium is going to interpret the URL. For example, \nFileController\n - which reads a file from the filesystem - might have a route \n/file/*\n. It uses everything after \n/file\n to figure out the path on the filesystem.\n\n\nAccessing Path Variables\n\n\nInformation that a router parses from a request path - like path variables - are stored in \nRequest.path\n. When a \nRequest\n is handled by a router, its \npath\n is set to an instance of this type. Controllers deeper in the channel access \nRequest.path\n to help determine which resource the request is identifying. The \npath\n is an instance of \nRequestPath\n.\n\n\nA \nRequestPath\n contains an map of \nvariables\n, where the key is path variable name and the value is the value of that variable in the request. For example, consider a route specification \n/users/:id\n. When a request with path \n/users/1\n is routed, the value \n1\n is stored in this map for the key \nid\n:\n\n\nfinal\n \nidentifier\n \n=\n \nrequest\n.\npath\n.\nvariables\n[\nid\n];\n\n\n// identifier = \n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe values in \nvariables\n are always \nString\ns, since a request path is a \nString\n. \nController\ns may parse path variables into types like \nint\n.\n\n\nResourceController\n uses path variables to select a operation method to handle a request.\n\n\nFailed Matches Return 404\n\n\nA \nRouter\n will return a \n404 Not Found\n if there is no matching route for the request. No linked controllers will handle the request. This behavior may be overridden by providing a closure to \nRouter\n's constructor.",

The following named constructors exist:\n\n\n\n\nOperation.post()\n\n\nOperation.get()\n\n\nOperation.put()\n\n\nOperation.delete()\n\n\n\n\nThe canonical \nOperation()\n constructor takes the HTTP method as its first argument for non-standard operations, e.g.:\n\n\n@\nOperation\n(\nPATCH\n,\n \nid\n)\n\n\nFuture\nResponse\n \npatchObjectWithID\n()\n \nasync\n \n=\n \n...;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll \nOperation\n constructors take a variable list of path variables. There can be multiple path variables for an operation. An operation method will only be invoked if all of its path variables are present in the request path. There can be multiple operation methods for a given HTTP method, as long as each expects a different set of path variables.\n\n\nHere's an example of an operation that requires two path variables:\n\n\n@\nOperation\n.\nget\n(\nuserID\n,\n \nitemID\n)\n\n\nFuture\nResponse\n \ngetUserItem\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n  \nfinal\n \nuserID\n \n=\n \nrequest\n.\npath\n.\nvariables\n[\nuserID\n];\n\n  \nfinal\n \nitemID\n \n=\n \nrequest\n.\npath\n.\nvariables\n[\nitemID\n];\n\n  \nreturn\n \nnew\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(...);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf no operation method exists for a request, a 405 Method Not Allowed response is automatically sent and no operation method is invoked.\n\n\nRouting to a ResourceController\n\n\nA \nResourceController\n subclass must be preceded by a \nRouter\n in the application channel. The \nRouter\n will parse path variables so that the controller can use them to determine which operation method should be invoked. A typical route to a \nResourceController\n contains an optional identifying path variable:\n\n\nrouter\n\n  \n.\nroute\n(\n/cities/[:name]\n)\n\n  \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nCityController\n());\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis route would allow \nCityController\n to implement operation methods for all HTTP methods with both no path variables and the 'name' path variable.\n\n\nIt is considered good practice to break sub-resources into their own controller. For example, the following is preferred:\n\n\nrouter\n\n  \n.\nroute\n(\n/cities/[:name]\n)\n\n  \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nCityController\n());\n\n\n\nrouter\n\n  \n.\nroute\n(\n/cities/:name/attractions/[:id]\n)\n\n  \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nCityAttractionController\n());\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy contrast, the route \n/cities/[:name/[attractions/[:id]]]\n, while valid, makes controller logic much more unwieldy.\n\n\nRequest Bindings\n\n\nOperation methods may \nbind\n properties of an HTTP request to its parameters. When the operation method is invoked, the value of that property is passed as an argument to the operation method. For example, the following binds the header named 'X-API-Key' to the argument \napiKey\n:\n\n\n@\nOperation\n.\nget\n(\nname\n)\n\n\nFuture\nResponse\n \ngetCityByName\n(\n@\nBind\n.\nheader\n(\nx-api-key\n)\n \nString\n \napiKey\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n  \nif\n \n(\n!\nisValid\n(\napiKey\n))\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \nnew\n \nResponse\n.\nunauthorized\n();\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \nreturn\n \nnew\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(...);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following table shows the possible types of bindings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty\n\n\nBinding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPath Variable\n\n\n@Bind.path(pathVariableName)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nURL Query Parameter\n\n\n@Bind.query(queryParameterName)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeader\n\n\n@Bind.header(headerName)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest Body\n\n\n@Bind.body()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may bind any number of HTTP request properties to a single operation method.\n\n\nOptional Bindings\n\n\nBindings can be made optional. If a binding is optional, the operation method will still be called even if the bound property isn't in a request. To make a binding optional, move it to the optional parameters of an operation method:\n\n\n@\nOperation\n.\nget\n()\n\n\nFuture\nResponse\n \ngetAllCities\n({\n@\nBind\n.\nheader\n(\nx-api-key\n)\n \nString\n \napiKey\n})\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n  \nif\n \n(\napiKey\n \n==\n \nnull\n)\n \n{\n\n    \n// No X-API-Key in request\n\n    \n...\n\n  \n}\n\n  \n...\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA bound parameter will be null if not in the request. Like any other Dart optional parameter, you can provide a default value:\n\n\n@\nOperation\n.\nget\n()\n\n\nFuture\nResponse\n \ngetAllCities\n({\n@\nBind\n.\nheader\n(\nx-api-key\n)\n \nString\n \napiKey:\n \npublic\n})\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n  \n...\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomatically Parsing Bindings\n\n\nQuery, header and path bindings can automatically be parsed into other types, such as \nint\n or \nDateTime\n. Simply declare the bound parameter's type to the desired type:\n\n\nFuture\nResponse\n \ngetCityByID\n(\n@\nBind\n.\nquery\n(\nid\n)\n \nint\n \ncityID\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe type of a bound parameter may be \nString\n or any type that implements \nparse\n (e.g., \nint\n, \nDateTime\n). Query parameters may also be bound to \nbool\n parameters; a boolean query parameter will be true if the query parameter has no value (e.g. \n/path?boolean\n).\n\n\nIf parsing fails for any reason, an error response is sent and the operation method is not called. For example, the above example binds \nint cityID\n - if the path variable 'id' can't be parsed into an \nint\n, a 404 Not Found response is sent. If a query parameter or header value cannot be parsed, a 400 Bad Request response is sent.\n\n\nYou may also bind \nList\nT\n parameters to headers and query parameters, where \nT\n must meet the same criteria as above. Query parameters and headers may appear more than once in a request. For example, the value of \nids\n is \n[1, 2]\n if the request URL ends with \n/path?id=1\nid=2\n and the operation method looks like this:\n\n\nFuture\nResponse\n \ngetCitiesByIDs\n(\n@\nBind\n.\nquery\n(\nid\n)\n \nList\nint\n \nids\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that if a parameter is \nnot\n bound to a list and there are multiple occurrences of that property in the request, a 400 Bad Request response will be sent. If you want to allow multiple values, you must bind to a \nList\nT\n.\n\n\nHeader Bindings\n\n\nThe following operation method binds the header named \nX-API-Key\n to the \napiKey\n parameter:\n\n\nclass\n \nCityController\n \nextends\n \nResourceController\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nOperation\n.\nget\n()\n\n  \nFuture\nResponse\n \ngetAllCities\n(\n@\nBind\n.\nheader\n(\nx-api-key\n)\n \nString\n \napiKey\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nif\n \n(\n!\nisValid\n(\napiKey\n))\n \n{\n\n      \nreturn\n \nnew\n \nResponse\n.\nunauthorized\n();\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nnew\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n([\nAtlanta\n,\n \nMadison\n,\n \nMountain View\n]);\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf an \nX-API-Key\n header is present in the request, its value will be available in \napiKey\n. If it is not, \ngetAllCities(apiKey)\n would not be called and a 400 Bad Request response will be sent. If \napiKey\n were optional, the method is called as normal and \napiKey\n is null or a default value.\n\n\nHeader names are case-insensitive per the HTTP specification. Therefore, the header name may be 'X-API-KEY', 'X-Api-Key' 'x-api-key', etc. and \napiKey\n will be bound in all cases.\n\n\nQuery Parameter Bindings\n\n\nThe following operation methods binds the query parameter named 'name' to the parameter \ncityName\n:\n\n\nclass\n \nCityController\n \nextends\n \nResourceController\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nOperation\n.\nget\n()\n\n  \nFuture\nResponse\n \ngetAllCities\n(\n@\nBind\n.\nquery\n(\nname\n)\n \nString\n \ncityName\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \nnew\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\ncities\n.\nwhere\n((\nc\n)\n \n=\n \nc\n.\nname\n \n==\n \ncityName\n).\ntoList\n());\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuery parameters can be required or optional. If required, a 400 Bad Request response is sent and no operation method is called if the query parameter is not present in the request URL. If optional, the bound variable is null or a default value.\n\n\nQuery parameters are case-sensitive; this binding will only match the query parameter 'name', but not 'Name' or 'NAME'.\n\n\nQuery parameters may also bound for query strings in the request body when the content-type is 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'.\n\n\nPath Variable Bindings\n\n\nThe following operation method binds the path variable 'id' to the parameter \ncityID\n:\n\n\nclass\n \nCityController\n \nextends\n \nResourceController\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nOperation\n.\nget\n(\nid\n)\n\n  \nFuture\nResponse\n \ngetCityByID\n(\n@\nBind\n.\nquery\n(\nid\n)\n \nString\n \ncityID\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \nnew\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\ncities\n.\nwhere\n((\nc\n)\n \n=\n \nc\n.\nid\n \n==\n \ncityID\n).\ntoList\n());\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPath variables are made available when creating \nroutes\n. A \nRouter\n must have a route that includes a path variable and that path variable must be listed in the \nOperation\n annotation. Path variables are case-sensitive and may not be optional.\n\n\nIf you attempt to bind a path variable that is not present in the \nOperation\n, you will get a runtime exception at startup. You do not have to bind path variables for an operation method to be invoked.\n\n\nHTTP Request Body Bindings\n\n\nThe body of an HTTP request can also be bound to a parameter:\n\n\nclass\n \nCityController\n \nextends\n \nResourceController\n \n{\n\n  \nCityController\n(\nthis\n.\ncontext\n);\n\n\n  \nfinal\n \nManagedContext\n \ncontext\n;\n\n\n  \n@\nOperation\n.\npost\n()\n\n  \nFuture\nResponse\n \naddCity\n(\n@\nBind\n.\nbody\n()\n \nCity\n \ncity\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nfinal\n \ninsertedCity\n \n=\n \nawait\n \ncontext\n.\ninsertObject\n(\ncity\n);\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nnew\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\ninsertedCity\n);\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince there is only one request body, \nBind.body()\n doesn't take any identifying arguments.\n\n\nThe bound parameter type (\nCity\n in this example) must implement \nSerializable\n. This interface requires two methods to be implemented: one to read data from a request body and another to write data to a response body. Here is an example:\n\n\nclass\n \nCity\n \nextends\n \nSerializable\n \n{\n\n  \nint\n \nid\n;\n\n  \nString\n \nname\n;\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nvoid\n \nreadFromMap\n(\nMap\nString\n,\n \ndynamic\n \nmap\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nid\n \n=\n \nmap\n[\nid\n];\n\n    \nname\n \n=\n \nmap\n[\nname\n];\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nMap\nString\n,\n \ndynamic\n \nasMap\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \n{\n\n      \nid\n:\n \nid\n,\n\n      \nname\n:\n \nname\n\n    \n}\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManagedObject and Serializable\n\n\nManagedObject\ns from Aqueduct's ORM implement \nSerializable\n without having to implement these two methods.\n\n\n\n\nAqueduct will automatically decode the request body from it's content-type, create a new instance of the bound parameter type, and invoke its \nreadFromMap\n method. In the above example, a valid request body would be the following JSON:\n\n\n{\n\n  \nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n  \nname\n:\n \nAtlanta\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTTP Body Decoding\n\n\nRequest bodies are decoded according to their content-type prior to being deserialized. For more information on request body decoding, including decoding content-types other than JSON, see \nthis guide\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf parsing fails or \nreadFromMap\n throws an exception, a 400 Bad Request response will be sent and the operation method won't be called.\n\n\nYou may also bind \nList\nSerializable\n parameters to the request body. Consider the following JSON that contains a list of cities:\n\n\n[\n\n  \n{\nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n \nname\n:\n \nAtlanta\n},\n\n  \n{\nid\n:\n \n2\n,\n \nname\n:\n \nMadison\n}\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis body can be bound by declaring the bound parameter to be a \nList\n of the desired type:\n\n\nFuture\nResponse\n \naddCity\n(\n@\nBind\n.\nbody\n()\n \nList\nCity\n \ncities\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList vs Object\n\n\nAn endpoint should either take a single object or a list of objects, but not both. If the request body is a JSON list and the bound variable is not a list, a 400 Bad Request response will be sent (and vice versa). Declaring a body binding of the appropriate type validates the expected value and aids in automatically generating an OpenAPI specification for your application.\n\n\n\n\nNote that if the request's \nContent-Type\n is 'x-www-form-urlencoded', its must be bound with \nBind.query\n and not \nBind.body\n.\n\n\nProperty Binding\n\n\nThe properties of an \nResourceController\ns may also have \nBind.query\n and \nBind.header\n metadata. This binds values from the request to the \nResourceController\n instance itself, making them accessible from \nall\n operation methods.\n\n\nclass\n \nCityController\n \nextends\n \nResourceController\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nrequiredBinding\n\n  \n@\nBind\n.\nheader\n(\nx-timestamp\n)\n\n  \nDateTime\n \ntimestamp\n;\n\n\n  \n@\nBind\n.\nquery\n(\nlimit\n)\n\n  \nint\n \nlimit\n;\n\n\n  \n@\nOperation\n.\nget\n()\n\n  \nFuture\nResponse\n \ngetCities\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n      \n// can use both limit and timestamp\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above, both \ntimestamp\n and \nlimit\n are bound prior to \ngetCities\n being invoked. By default, a bound property is optional. Adding an \nrequiredBinding\n annotation changes a property to required. If required, any request without the required property fails with a 400 Bad Request status code and none of the operation methods are invoked.\n\n\nOther ResourceController Behavior\n\n\nBesides binding, \nResourceController\ns have some other behavior that is important to understand.\n\n\nRequest and Response Bodies\n\n\nAn \nResourceController\n can limit the content type of HTTP request bodies it accepts. By default, an \nResourceController\n will accept only \napplication/json\n request bodies for its \nPOST\n and \nPUT\n methods. This can be modified by setting the \nacceptedContentTypes\n property in the constructor.\n\n\nclass\n \nUserController\n \nextends\n \nResourceController\n \n{\n\n  \nUserController\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nacceptedContentTypes\n \n=\n \n[\nContentType\n.\nJSON\n,\n \nContentType\n.\nXML\n];\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a request is made with a content type other than the accepted content types, the controller automatically responds with a 415 Unsupported Media Type response.\n\n\nThe body of an HTTP request is decoded if the content type is accepted and there exists a operation method to handle the request. The body is not decoded if there is not a matching operation method for the request. The body is decoded by \nResourceController\n prior to your operation method being invoked. Therefore, you can always use the synchronous \nRequestBody.as\n method to access the body from within an operation method:\n\n\n@\nOperation\n.\npost\n()\n\n\nFuture\nResponse\n \ncreateThing\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n  \n// do this:\n\n  \nMap\nString\n,\n \ndynamic\n \nbodyMap\n \n=\n \nrequest\n.\nbody\n.\nas\n();\n\n\n  \n// no need to do this:\n\n  \nMap\nString\n,\n \ndynamic\n \nbodyMap\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nrequest\n.\nbody\n.\ndecode\n();\n\n\n  \nreturn\n \n...;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn \nResourceController\n can also have a default content type for its responses. By default, this is \napplication/json\n. This default can be changed by changing \nresponseContentType\n in the constructor:\n\n\nclass\n \nUserController\n \nextends\n \nResourceController\n \n{\n\n  \nUserController\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nresponseContentType\n \n=\n \nContentType\n.\nXML\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nresponseContentType\n is the \ndefault\n response content type. An individual \nResponse\n may set its own \ncontentType\n, which takes precedence over the \nresponseContentType\n. For example, the following controller returns JSON by default, but if the request specifically asks for XML, that's what it will return:\n\n\nclass\n \nUserController\n \nextends\n \nResourceController\n \n{\n\n  \nUserController\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nresponseContentType\n \n=\n \nContentType\n.\nJSON\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \n@\nOperation\n.\nget\n(\nid\n)\n\n  \nFuture\nResponse\n \ngetUserByID\n(\n@\nBind\n.\npath\n(\nid\n)\n \nint\n \nid\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nvar\n \nresponse\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(...);\n\n\n    \nif\n \n(\nrequest\n.\nheaders\n.\nvalue\n(\nBind\n.\nheaders\n.\nACCEPT\n).\nstartsWith\n(\napplication/xml\n))\n \n{\n\n      \nresponse\n.\ncontentType\n \n=\n \nContentType\n.\nXML\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nresponse\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Specialized ResourceControllers\n\n\nMany \nResourceController\n subclasses will execute \nqueries\n. There are helpful \nResourceController\n subclasses for reducing boilerplate code.\n\n\nA \nQueryController\nT\n builds a \nQuery\nT\n based on the incoming request. If the request has a body, this \nQuery\nT\n's \nvalues\n property is read from that body. If the request has a path variable, the \nQuery\nT\n assigns an expression to the primary key value. For example, in a normal \nResourceController\n that responds to a PUT request, you might write the following:\n\n\n@\nOperation\n.\nput\n(\nid\n)\n\n\nFuture\nResponse\n \nupdateUser\n(\n@\nBind\n.\npath\n(\nid\n)\n \nint\n \nid\n,\n \n@\nBind\n.\nbody\n()\n \nUser\n \nuser\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n  \nvar\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nQuery\nUser\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n    \n..\nwhere\n((\nu\n)\n \n=\n \nu\n.\nid\n).\nequalTo\n(\nid\n)\n\n    \n..\nvalues\n \n=\n \nuser\n;\n\n\n  \nreturn\n \nnew\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\nawait\n \nquery\n.\nupdateOne\n());\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA \nQueryController\nT\n builds this query before a operation method is invoked, storing it in the inherited \nquery\n property. A \nManagedObject\nT\n subclass is the type argument to \nQueryController\nT\n.\n\n\nclass\n \nUserController\n \nextends\n \nQueryController\nUser\n \n{\n\n  \nUserController\n(\nManagedContext\n \ncontext\n)\n \n:\n \nsuper\n(\ncontext\n);\n\n\n  \n@\nOperation\n.\nput\n(\nid\n)\n\n  \nFuture\nResponse\n \nupdateUser\n(\n@\nBind\n.\npath\n(\nid\n)\n \nint\n \nid\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \n// query already exists and is identical to the snippet above\n\n    \nvar\n \nresult\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nquery\n.\nupdateOne\n();\n\n    \nreturn\n \nnew\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\nresult\n);\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA \nManagedObjectController\nT\n is significantly more powerful; you don't even need to subclass it. It does all the things a CRUD endpoint does without any code. Here's an example usage:\n\n\nrouter\n\n  \n.\nroute\n(\n/users/[:id]\n)\n\n  \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nManagedObjectController\nUser\n(\ncontext\n));\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis controller has the following behavior:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPOST /users\n\n\nInserts a user into the database with values from the request body\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET /users\n\n\nFetches all users in the database\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET /users/:id\n\n\nFetches a single user by id\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDELETE /users/:id\n\n\nDeletes a single user by id\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPUT /users/:id\n\n\nUpdated a single user by id, using values from the request body\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe objects returned from getting the collection - e.g, \nGET /users\n - can be modified with query parameters. For example, the following request will return the users sorted by their name in ascending order:\n\n\nGET /users?sortBy=name,asc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results can be paged (see \nPaging in Advanced Queries\n) with query parameters \noffset\n, \ncount\n, \npageBy\n, \npageAfter\n and \npagePrior\n.\n\n\nA \nManagedObjectController\nT\n can also be subclassed. A subclass allows for callbacks to be overridden to adjust the query before execution, or the results before sending the respond.

There can be multiple path variables for an operation. An operation method will only be invoked if all of its path variables are present in the request path. There can be multiple operation methods for a given HTTP method, as long as each expects a different set of path variables.

Aqueduct will automatically decode the request body from it's content-type, create a new instance of the bound parameter type, and invoke its  readFromMap  method. In the above example, a valid request body would be the following JSON:  { \n   id :   1 , \n   name :   Atlanta  }    HTTP Body Decoding  Request bodies are decoded according to their content-type prior to being deserialized. For more information on request body decoding, including decoding content-types other than JSON, see  this guide .   If parsing fails or  readFromMap  throws an exception, a 400 Bad Request response will be sent and the operation method won't be called.

Consider the following JSON that contains a list of cities:  [ \n   { id :   1 ,   name :   Atlanta }, \n   { id :   2 ,   name :   Madison }  ]   This body can be bound by declaring the bound parameter to be a  List  of the desired type:  Future Response   addCity ( @ Bind . body ()   List City   cities )    List vs Object  An endpoint should either take a single object or a list of objects, but not both. If the request body is a JSON list and the bound variable is not a list, a 400 Bad Request response will be sent (and vice versa). Declaring a body binding of the appropriate type validates the expected value and aids in automatically generating an OpenAPI specification for your application.

The body of an HTTP request is decoded if the content type is accepted and there exists a operation method to handle the request. The body is not decoded if there is not a matching operation method for the request. The body is decoded by  ResourceController  prior to your operation method being invoked. Therefore, you can always use the synchronous  RequestBody.as  method to access the body from within an operation method:  @ Operation . post ()  Future Response   createThing ()   async   { \n   // do this: \n   Map String ,   dynamic   bodyMap   =   request . body . as (); \n\n   // no need to do this: \n   Map String ,   dynamic   bodyMap   =   await   request . body . decode (); \n\n   return   ...;  }   An  ResourceController  can also have a default content type for its responses.

If the request has a path variable, the  Query T  assigns an expression to the primary key value. For example, in a normal  ResourceController  that responds to a PUT request, you might write the following:  @ Operation . put ( id )  Future Response   updateUser ( @ Bind . path ( id )   int   id ,   @ Bind . body ()   User   user )   async   { \n   var   query   =   new   Query User ( context ) \n     .. where (( u )   =   u . id ). equalTo ( id ) \n     .. values   =   user ; \n\n   return   new   Response . ok ( await   query . updateOne ());  }   A  QueryController T  builds this query before a operation method is invoked, storing it in the inherited  query  property. A  ManagedObject T  subclass is the type argument to  QueryController T .  class   UserController   extends   QueryController User   { \n   UserController ( ManagedContext   context )   :   super ( context ); \n\n   @ Operation . put ( id ) \n   Future Response   updateUser ( @ Bind . path ( id )   int   id )   async   { \n     // query already exists and is identical to the snippet above \n     var   result   =   await   query . updateOne (); \n     return   new   Response . ok ( result ); \n   }  }   A  ManagedObjectController T  is significantly more powerful; you don't even need to subclass it. It does all the things a CRUD endpoint does without any code. Here's an example usage:  router \n   . route ( /users/[:id] ) \n   . link (()   =   new   ManagedObjectController User ( context ));   This controller has the following behavior:     Request  Action      POST /users  Inserts a user into the database with values from the request body    GET /users  Fetches all users in the database    GET /users/:id  Fetches a single user by id    DELETE /users/:id  Deletes a single user by id    PUT /users/:id  Updated a single user by id, using values from the request body     The objects returned from getting the collection - e.g,  GET /users  - can be modified with query parameters. For example, the following request will return the users sorted by their name in ascending order:  GET /users?sortBy=name,asc   The results can be paged (see  Paging in Advanced Queries ) with query parameters  offset ,  count ,  pageBy ,  pageAfter  and  pagePrior .  A  ManagedObjectController T  can also be subclassed. A subclass allows for callbacks to be overridden to adjust the query before execution, or the results before sending the respond. Each operation - fetch, update, delete, etc. - has a pair of methods to do this. For example, the following subclass alters the query and results before any update via  PUT :  class   UserController   extends   ManagedObjectController User   { \n   UserController ( ManagedContext   context )   :   super ( context ); \n\n   Future Query User   willUpdateObjectWithQuery ( \n       Query User   query )   async   { \n     query . values . lastUpdatedAt   =   new   DateTime . now (). toUtc (); \n     return   query ; \n   } \n\n   Future Response   didUpdateObject ( User   object )   async   { \n     object . removePropertyFromBackingMap ( private ); \n     return   new   Response . ok ( object ); \n   }  }   See the chapter on  validations , which are powerful when combined with  ManagedObjectController T .",

In order for the server to send data to a client, the client must have sent a request for that data. A \nwebsocket\n is a special type of HTTP request that stays open, and both the server and client can send data to one another whenever they please.\n\n\nFor example, a chat application might use websockets to send messages to everyone in a chatroom. In this scenario, the chat client application opens a websocket connection to the server application. When the user types a message, their chat client sends that message on its websocket. The payload might be JSON data that looks like this:\n\n\n{\n\n  \naction\n:\n \nsend_message\n,\n\n  \nroom\n:\n \ngeneral\n,\n\n  \ntext\n:\n \nHi everyone\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe server will receive this data, then turn around and send a modified version to \nevery\n websocket connection it has.

(See the section on \nAqueduct and dart:io\n \nin this guide\n for more details.)\n\n\nA client application can connect to the URL \nws://localhost:8888/connect\n. A Dart application would make this connection like so:\n\n\nvar\n \nsocket\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nWebSocket\n.\nconnect\n(\nws://localhost:8888/connect\n);\n\n\nsocket\n.\nlisten\n(...);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBi-directional Communication\n\n\nIn the simple example above, the server only listens for data from the client. For data to be sent to the client, a reference must be kept to the \nWebSocket\n so that data can be added to it. How an Aqueduct application manages its websocket connections depends greatly on the behavior of the application, the number of isolates the application is running on and the infrastructure of the system as a whole.\n\n\nA simple application might keep track of websocket connections in a \nMap\n, where the key is a user identifier acquired from the authorization of the request:\n\n\nrouter\n\n  \n.\nroute\n(\n/connect\n)\n\n  \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nAuthorizer\n(\nauthServer\n));\n\n  \n.\nlinkFunction\n((\nrequest\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nvar\n \nuserID\n \n=\n \nrequest\n.\nauthorization\n.\nownerID\n;\n\n    \nvar\n \nsocket\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nWebSocketTransformer\n.\nupgrade\n(\nrequest\n.\nraw\n);\n\n    \nsocket\n.\nlisten\n((\nevent\n)\n \n=\n \nhandleEvent\n(\nevent\n,\n \nfromUserID:\n \nuserID\n));\n\n\n    \nconnections\n[\nuserID\n]\n \n=\n \nsocket\n;\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nnull\n;\n\n  \n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we continue with the 'chat application' example, the code for \nhandleEvent\n may be something like:\n\n\nvoid\n \nhandleEvent\n(\ndynamic\n \nevent\n,\n \n{\nint\n \nfromUserID\n})\n \n{\n\n  \nvar\n \nincoming\n \n=\n \njson\n.\ndecode\n(\nUTF8\n.\ndecode\n(\nevent\n));\n\n  \nvar\n \noutgoing\n \n=\n \nutf8\n.\nencode\n(\njson\n.\nencode\n({\n\n    \ntext\n:\n \nincoming\n[\ntext\n],\n\n    \n...\n\n  \n}));\n\n\n  \nconnections\n.\nkeys\n\n    \n.\nwhere\n((\nuserID\n)\n \n=\n \nuserID\n \n!=\n \nfromUserID\n)\n\n    \n.\nforEach\n((\nuserID\n)\n \n{\n\n      \nvar\n \nconnection\n \n=\n \nconnections\n[\nuserID\n];\n\n      \nconnection\n.\nadd\n(\noutgoing\n);\n\n    \n});\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that this simple implementation doesn't account for multiple connections from the same user or multi-isolate applications.\n\n\nConsiderations for Multi-Isolate and Multi-Instance Applications\n\n\nBy default, an Aqueduct application runs on multiple isolates. Since each isolate has its own heap, a websocket created on one isolate is not directly accessible by another isolate. In the example above, each isolate would have its own map of connections - therefore, a message is only sent to connections that were opened on the same isolate that the chat message originated from.\n\n\nA simple solution is to only run the application on a single isolate, ensuring that all websockets are on a single isolate and accessible to one another:\n\n\naqueduct\n \nserve\n \n-\nn\n \n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor many applications, this is a fine solution. For others, it may not be.\n\n\nRecall that one of the benefits of Aqueduct's multi-isolate architecture is that code tested on a single instance will scale to multiple instances behind a load balancer. If an Aqueduct application runs correctly on a single, multi-isolate instance, it will run correctly on multiple instances. This (somewhat) enforced structure prevents us from naively keeping track of websocket connections on a single isolate, which would cause issues when we scale out to a multi-instance system.\n\n\nIf you find yourself in a situation where your application is so popular you need multiple servers to efficiently serve requests, you'll have a good idea on how to architect an appropriate solution (or you'll have the money to hire someone that does). In many situations, the REST API and websocket server are separate instances anyhow - they have different lifecycles and deployment behavior. It may make sense to run a websocket server on a single isolate, since you are likely IO-bound instead of CPU bound.\n\n\nIf you still prefer to have a multi-isolate server with websockets, the \nApplicationMessageHub\n will come in handy. When broadcasting messages to connected websockets across the application, you first send the data to each websocket connected to the isolate that is originating the message. Then, the message is added to the \nApplicationMessageHub\n:\n\n\nvoid\n \nonChatMessage\n(\nString\n \nmessage\n)\n \n{\n\n  \nconnectedSockets\n.\nforEach\n((\nsocket\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nsocket\n.\nadd\n(\nmessage\n);\n\n  \n});\n\n\n  \nApplicationChannel\n.\nmessageHub\n.\nadd\n({\nevent\n:\n \nwebsocket_broadcast\n,\n \nmessage\n:\n \nmessage\n});\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything added to the \nmessageHub\n will be delivered to the listener for every other message hub - i.e., every other isolate will receive this data. The other isolates then send the message to each of their connected websockets:\n\n\nclass\n \nChatChannel\n \nextends\n \nApplicationChannel\n \n{\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nFuture\n \nprepare\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nmessageHub\n.\nlisten\n((\nevent\n)\n \n{\n\n      \nif\n \n(\nevent\n \nis\n \nMap\n \n \nevent\n[\nevent\n]\n \n==\n \nwebsocket_broadcast\n)\n \n{\n\n        \nconnectedSockets\n.\nforEach\n((\nsocket\n)\n \n{\n\n          \nsocket\n.\nadd\n(\nevent\n[\nmessage\n]);\n\n        \n});\n\n      \n}\n\n    \n});\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}",

When developing locally, use \nPostgres.app\n to set up a development database server quickly. After running this application, create or select a new database server from the left-hand menu, and then double-click any of the database icons to open the \npsql\n command-line tool. (If you are not using \nPostgres.app\n, make sure \npsql\n is in your \n$PATH\n and run it from the command-line.)\n\n\nInside \npsql\n, enter the following commands to create a database and a database user for your application:\n\n\nCREATE\n \nDATABASE\n \nmy_app_name\n;\n\n\nCREATE\n \nUSER\n \nmy_app_name_user\n \nWITH\n \nPASSWORD\n \npassword\n;\n\n\nGRANT\n \nALL\n \nON\n \nDATABASE\n \nmy_app_name\n \nTO\n \nmy_app_name_user\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing ManagedContext to Connect to a Database\n\n\nThe interface to a database from Aqueduct is an instance of \nManagedContext\n that contains the following two objects:\n\n\n\n\na \nManagedDataModel\n that describes your application's data model\n\n\na \nPersistentStore\n that manages a connection to a single database\n\n\n\n\nA \nManagedContext\n uses these two objects to coordinate moving data to and from your application and a database. A\nQuery\nT\n object uses a context's persistent store to determine which database to send commands to, and a data model to map database rows to objects and vice versa.\n\n\nA context, like all service objects, is created in \nApplicationChannel.prepare\n.\n\n\nclass\n \nMyApplicationChannel\n \nextends\n \nApplicationChannel\n \n{\n\n  \nManagedContext\n \ncontext\n;\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nFuture\n \nprepare\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nvar\n \ndataModel\n \n=\n \nManagedDataModel\n.\nfromCurrentMirrorSystem\n();\n\n    \nvar\n \npsc\n \n=\n \nPostgreSQLPersistentStore\n.\nfromConnectionInfo\n(\n\n        \nmy_app_name_user\n,\n \npassword\n,\n \nlocalhost\n,\n \n5432\n,\n \nmy_app_name\n);\n\n\n    \ncontext\n \n=\n \nManagedContext\n(\ndataModel\n,\n \npsc\n);\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nManagedDataModel.fromCurrentMirrorSystem\n finds every \nManagedObject\nT\n subclass in your application's code.

At the end of this guide are additional examples of data model types.\n\n\nDefining a Table\n\n\nIn your application, you declare types whose instances are stored in a database. Each of these types is mapped to a database table, where each property of the type is a column of the table. For example, consider modeling newspaper articles, where each article has a unique identifier, text contents and published date:\n\n\n// This is a table definition of an \narticle\n\n\nclass\n \n_Article\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nColumn\n(\nprimaryKey:\n \ntrue\n)\n\n  \nint\n \nid\n;\n\n\n  \nString\n \ncontents\n;\n\n\n  \n@\nColumn\n(\nindexed:\n \ntrue\n)\n\n  \nDateTime\n \npublishedDate\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plain Dart class is called a \ntable definition\n because it defines a database table named \n_Article\n. The table has three columns, \nid\n, \ncontents\n, \npublishedDate\n. An example of the data stored in this table might look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\n\n\ncontents\n\n\npublishedDate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nToday, the local...\n\n\n2018-02-01 00:00:00.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nIn other news, ...\n\n\n2018-03-01 04:30:00.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA property in a table definition can optionally have a \nColumn\n annotation.

Use the \ndatabaseType\n of a \nColumn\n annotation to specify:\n\n\n@\nColumn\n(\ndatabaseType:\n \nManagedType\n.\nbigInteger\n)\n\n\nint\n \nbigNumber\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only requirement of a table definition type is that it has exactly one primary key property. A primary key is an indexed, unique identifier for a database row and is set through the \nColumn\n annotation.\n\n\n@\nColumn\n(\nprimaryKey:\n \ntrue\n)\n\n\nint\n \nid\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA primary key can be any supported data type, and it is always unique and indexed. It is common for primary keys to be 64-bit, auto-incrementing integers. The \nprimaryKey\n constant exists as a convenience for a \nColumn\n with these behaviors.\n\n\nclass\n \n_Article\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nprimaryKey\n \n// equivalent to @Column(primaryKey: true, databaseType: ManagedType.bigInteger, autoincrement: true)\n\n  \nint\n \nid\n;\n\n\n  \n...\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating Tables\n\n\nTables are created in a database by using the \naqueduct\n command line tool to generate and execute migration scripts. The tool inspects your database types and automatically synchronizes a databases schema to match your them.\n\n\n\n\nBy default, the name of the table definition is the name of the database table. You can configure this with the \nTable\n annotation.\n\n\n@\nTable\n(\nname:\n \nArticleTable\n)\n\n\nclass\n \n_Article\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nprimaryKey\n\n  \nint\n \nid\n;\n\n\n  \nString\n \ncontents\n;\n\n\n  \n@\nColumn\n(\nindexed:\n \ntrue\n)\n\n  \nDateTime\n \npublishedDate\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is convention that table definitions are \nprivate classes\n, that is, their name is prefixed with an underscore (\n_\n). This convention is discussed later in this guide.\n\n\nDefining a Managed Object Subclass\n\n\nA table definition by itself is just a plain Dart class. You must also declare a \nManagedObject\n subclass to bring your table definition to life. Here's an example:\n\n\nclass\n \nArticle\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_Article\n \nimplements\n \n_Article\n \n{}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA managed object subclass, also called the \ninstance type\n, is the object type that you work with in your application code. For example, when you fetch rows from a database, you will get a list of managed objects. A managed object subclass declares its table definition in two places: once as the type argument of its superclass, and again as an interface it implements.\n\n\nA managed object subclass inherits all of the properties from its table definition; i.e., an \nArticle\n has an \nid\n, \ncontents\n and \npublishedDate\n because \n_Article\n declares those properties. You create and use instances of a managed object subclass like any other object:\n\n\nfinal\n \narticle\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nArticle\n();\n\n\narticle\n.\ntext\n \n=\n \nToday, ...\n;\n\n\narticle\n.\npublishedDate\n \n=\n \nDateTime\n.\nnow\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManaged Object Constructors\n\n\nYou can add new constructors to a managed object subclass, but you must always have a default, no-argument constructor. This default constructor is used when the ORM creates instances from rows in your database.\n\n\n\n\nModeling Relationships\n\n\nA managed object can have \nrelationships\n to other managed objects. For example, an author can have many books, an article can belong to a newspaper, and an employee can have a manager. In a relational database, relationships between tables are established by storing the primary key of a table row in a column of the related table. This column is a \nforeign key reference\n to the related table.\n\n\nWhen a table has a foreign key reference, it is said to \nbelong to\n the related table. In the example of an employee and manager, the employee \nbelongs to\n the manager and therefore the employee table has a foreign key reference to the manager table. The inverse of this statement is also true: a manager \nhas\n employees. A manager has-many employees - this is called a \nhas-many relationship\n. There are also \nhas-one relationships\n - for example, a country has-one capital.\n\n\nThe following is an example of a country and a has-one relationship to a capital city:\n\n\nclass\n \nCity\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_City\n \nimplements\n \n_City\n \n{}\n\n\nclass\n \n_City\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nprimaryKey\n\n  \nint\n \nid\n;\n\n\n  \n@\nRelate\n(\n#\ncapital\n)\n\n  \nCountry\n \ncountry\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nclass\n \nCountry\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_Country\n \nimplements\n \n_Country\n \n{}\n\n\nclass\n \n_Country\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nprimaryKey\n\n  \nint\n \nid\n;\n\n\n  \nCity\n \ncapital\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA relationship is formed between two tables by declaring properties in both table definition types. The type of those properties is the related managed object subclass - so a \nCountry\n has a property of type \nCity\n, and a \nCity\n has a property of type \nCountry\n.\n\n\nExactly one of those properties must have a \nRelate\n annotation. The \nRelate\n annotation designates the underlying column as a foreign key column. In this example, the city table has a foreign key column to the country table. Conceptually, then, a city \nbelongs to\n a country and a country has-one capital city. A city can only belong to one country through this relationship, and that is true of all belongs-to relationship properties.\n\n\n\n\nForeign Key Column Names\n\n\nA foreign key column in the database is named by joining the name of the relationship property and the primary key of the related table with an underscore. For example, the column in the city table is named \ncountry_id\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe property without \nRelate\n is the \ninverse\n of the relationship and is conceptually either a has-one or has-many relationship property. In this example, a country's relationship to its capital is has-one. A relationship is has-many when the type of the inverse property is a \nManagedSet\n. For example, if we wanted to model a relationship between a country and all of its cities, we'd declare a \nManagedSet\nCity\n property in the country:\n\n\nclass\n \nCity\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_City\n \nimplements\n \n_City\n \n{}\n\n\nclass\n \n_City\n \n{\n\n  \n...\n\n\n  \n@\nRelate\n(\n#\ncities\n)\n\n  \nCountry\n \ncountry\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nclass\n \nCountry\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_Country\n \nimplements\n \n_Country\n \n{}\n\n\nclass\n \n_Country\n \n{\n\n  \n...\n\n\n  \nManagedSet\nCity\n \ncities\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManagedSet Behavior\n\n\nA \nRelate\n property can never be a \nManagedSet\n. A \nManagedSet\n is a \nList\n, and therefore can be used in the same way a list is used.\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the \nRelate\n annotation takes at least one argument: a symbol that matches the name of the inverse property. This is what links two relationship properties to each other. In the first example, this argument was \n#capital\n because the name of the inverse property is \ncapital\n; likewise, \n#cities\n and \ncities\n. This pairing name must match or an error will be thrown.\n\n\n\n\nSymbols\n\n\nA symbol is a name identifier in Dart; a symbol can refer to a class, method, or property. The \n#name\n syntax is a \nsymbol literal\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nRelate\n annotation has optional arguments to further define the relationship. Like \nColumn\n, these are optional arguments, e.g.:\n\n\n@\nRelate\n(\n#\ncities\n,\n \nisRequired:\n \ntrue\n,\n \nrule:\n \nDeleteRule\n.\ncascade\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA relationship may be be required or optional. For example, if \nCity.country\n were required, than an \nCity\n must always have an \nCountry\n. By default, relationships are optional.\n\n\nA relationship has a delete rule. When an object is deleted, any objects that belong to its relationships are subject to this rule. The following table shows the rules and their behavior:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRule\n\n\nBehavior\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnullify (default)\n\n\ninverse is set to null\n\n\nWhen deleting an author, its articles' author becomes null\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncascade\n\n\nrelated objects are also deleted\n\n\nWhen deleting an author, its articles are deleted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrestrict\n\n\ndelete fails\n\n\nWhen attempting to delete an author with articles, the delete operation fails\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndefault\n\n\ninverse set to a default value\n\n\nWhen deleting an author, its articles author is set to the default value of the column\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Behaviors\n\n\nEnum Types\n\n\nEnums types can be used to declare properties in a table definition. The database will store the column as a string representation of the enumeration. Here's an example where a user can be an administrator or a normal user:\n\n\nenum\n \nUserType\n \n{\n\n  \nadmin\n,\n \nuser\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nclass\n \nUser\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_User\n \nimplements\n \n_User\n \n{}\n\n\nclass\n \n_User\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nprimaryKey\n\n  \nint\n \nid\n;\n\n\n  \nString\n \nname\n;\n\n\n  \nUserType\n \nrole\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nvar\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nUser\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nvalues\n.\nname\n \n=\n \nBob\n\n  \n..\nvalues\n.\nrole\n \n=\n \nUserType\n.\nadmin\n;\n\n\nfinal\n \nbob\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nquery\n.\ninsert\n();\n\n\n\nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nUser\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nwhere\n((\nu\n)\n \n=\n \nu\n.\nrole\n).\nequalTo\n(\nUserType\n.\nadmin\n);\n\n\nfinal\n \nallAdmins\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nquery\n.\nfetch\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the database, the \nrole\n column is stored as a string. Its value is either \"admin\" or \"user\".\n\n\nPrivate Variables\n\n\nA private variable in a table definition removes it from the serialized representation of an object. A private variable is always fetched when making a database query, but it is not read when invoking \nreadFromMap\n and is not written when invoking \nasMap\n. Both of these methods are invoked when reading a managed object from a request body, or writing it to a response body.\n\n\nTransient Properties\n\n\nProperties declares in a managed object subclass are called \ntransient\n because they are not stored in a database. For example, consider an \nAuthor\n type that stores first and last name as separate columns. Instead of redundantly storing a 'full name' in the database, a transient property can combine the first and last name:\n\n\nclass\n \nAuthor\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_Author\n \nimplements\n \n_Author\n \n{\n\n  \nString\n \nget\n \nname\n \n=\n \n$\nfirstName\n \n$\nlastName\n;\n\n  \nset\n \nname\n(\nString\n \nfullName\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nfirstName\n \n=\n \nfullName\n.\nsplit\n(\n \n).\nfirst\n;\n\n    \nlastName\n \n=\n \nfullName\n.\nsplit\n(\n \n).\nlast\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\nclass\n \n_Author\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nprimaryKey\n\n  \nint\n \nid\n;\n\n\n  \nString\n \nfirstName\n;\n\n  \nString\n \nlastName\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, a transient property is ignored when reading an object from a request body or writing the object to a response body (see the guide on \nserialization\n for more details). You can annotate a transient property with \nSerialize\n so that it is able to be read from a request body, written to a response body, or both. For example:\n\n\nclass\n \nAuthor\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_Author\n \nimplements\n \n_Author\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nSerialize\n()\n\n  \nString\n \nget\n \nname\n \n=\n \n$\nfirstName\n \n$\nlastName\n;\n\n\n  \n@\nSerialize\n()\n\n  \nset\n \nname\n(\nString\n \nfullName\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nfirstName\n \n=\n \nfullName\n.\nsplit\n(\n \n).\nfirst\n;\n\n    \nlastName\n \n=\n \nfullName\n.\nsplit\n(\n \n).\nlast\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may declare getters, setters and properties to be serialized in this way. When declaring a property, you can control it with arguments to \nSerialize\n:\n\n\nclass\n \nAuthor\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_Author\n \nimplements\n \n_Author\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nSerialize\n(\ninput:\n \nfalse\n,\n \noutput:\n \ntrue\n)\n\n  \nbool\n \nisCurrentlyPromoted\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject File Structure\n\n\nA managed object subclass and its table definition together are called an \nentity\n. Each entity should be declared in the same file, and the table definition should be prefixed with an \n_\n to prevent it from being used elsewhere in the project. It is preferable to declare one entity per file, and store all entities in the \nlib/model/\n directory of your project.\n\n\nThe files your model definitions are declared in must be visible to Aqueduct tooling. In normal circumstances, this happens automatically because of the following:\n\n\n\n\nAqueduct tooling can find any file that is imported (directly or transitively) from your library file.\n\n\nYour library file, by default, can see the file your \nApplicationChannel\n is declared in.\n\n\nYour application channel file must import any controller that it links.\n\n\nYour controllers must import any model file they use.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you use the \naqueduct\n CLI to generate database migration scripts, it will report all of the \nManagedObject\ns in your application that it was able to find. If a particular type is not listed, it may reveal that you aren't using that type. If you need to ensure that the tooling can see a particular model file that it is not locating, you may import it in your \nchannel.dart\n file.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nExample: One-to-Many Relationship\n\n\nAn author has many books:\n\n\nclass\n \nAuthor\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_Author\n \nimplements\n \n_Author\n \n{}\n\n\nclass\n \n_Author\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nprimaryKey\n\n  \nint\n \nid\n;\n\n\n  \nString\n \nname\n;\n\n\n  \nManagedSet\nBook\n \nbooks\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nclass\n \nBook\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_Book\n \nimplements\n \n_Book\n \n{}\n\n\nclass\n \n_Book\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nprimaryKey\n\n  \nint\n \nid\n;\n\n\n  \nString\n \nname\n;\n\n\n  \n@\nRelate\n(\n#\nbooks\n)\n\n  \nAuthor\n \nauthor\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo insert an author and a book associated with that author:\n\n\nfinal\n \nauthorQuery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nAuthor\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nvalues\n.\nname\n \n=\n \nFred\n;\n\n\nfinal\n \nauthor\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nauthorQuery\n.\ninsert\n();\n\n\n\nfinal\n \nbookQuery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nBook\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nvalues\n.\nname\n \n=\n \nTitle\n\n  \n..\nvalues\n.\nauthor\n.\nid\n \n=\n \nauthor\n.\nid\n;\n\n\nfinal\n \nbook\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nbookQuery\n.\ninsert\n();\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nTo fetch authors and their books:\n\n\nfinal\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nAuthor\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\njoin\n(\nset\n:\n \n(\na\n)\n \n=\n \na\n.\nbooks\n);\n\n\nfinal\n \nauthors\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nquery\n.\nfetch\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo fetch a book and their full author object:\n\n\nfinal\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nBook\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nwhere\n((\nb\n)\n \n=\n \nb\n.\nid\n).\nequalTo\n(\n1\n)\n\n  \n..\njoin\n(\nobject:\n \n(\na\n)\n \n=\n \na\n.\nauthor\n);\n\n\nfinal\n \nbooks\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nquery\n.\nfetch\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: One-to-One Relationship\n\n\nclass\n \nCountry\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_Country\n \nimplements\n \n_Country\n \n{}\n\n\nclass\n \n_Country\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nprimaryKey\n\n  \nint\n \nid\n;\n\n\n  \nString\n \nname\n;\n\n\n  \nCity\n \ncapital\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nclass\n \nCity\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_City\n \nimplements\n \n_City\n \n{}\n\n\nclass\n \n_City\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nprimaryKey\n\n  \nint\n \nid\n;\n\n\n  \nString\n \nname\n;\n\n\n  \n@\nRelate\n(\n#\ncapital\n)\n\n  \nCountry\n \ncountry\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo fetch a country and its capital:\n\n\nfinal\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nCountry\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nwhere\n((\nc\n)\n \n=\n \nc\n.\nid\n).\nequalTo\n(\n1\n)\n\n  \n..\njoin\n(\nobject:\n \n(\na\n)\n \n=\n \na\n.\ncapital\n);\n\n\nfinal\n \ncountries\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nquery\n.\nfetch\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Many-to-Many Relationship\n\n\nclass\n \nTeam\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_Team\n \nimplements\n \n_Team\n \n{}\n\n\nclass\n \n_Team\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nprimaryKey\n\n  \nint\n \nid\n;\n\n\n  \nString\n \nname\n;\n\n\n  \nManagedSet\nTeamPlayer\n \nteamPlayers\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n// This type is a join table\n\n\nclass\n \n_TeamPlayer\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_TeamPlayer\n \nimplements\n \n_TeamPlayer\n \n{}\n\n\nclass\n \n_TeamPlayer\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nprimaryKey\n\n  \nint\n \nid\n;\n  \n\n  \n@\nRelate\n(\n#\nteamPlayers\n)\n\n  \nTeam\n \nteam\n;\n\n\n  \n@\nRelate\n(\n#\nteamPlayers\n)\n\n  \nPlayer\n \nplayer\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nclass\n \nPlayer\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_Player\n \nimplements\n \n_Player\n \n{}\n\n\nclass\n \n_Player\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nprimaryKey\n\n  \nint\n \nid\n;\n\n\n  \nString\n \nname\n;\n\n\n  \nManagedSet\nTeamPlayer\n \nteamPlayers\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo fetch a team and its players:\n\n\n// Note that the final join is not cascaded from the Team query,\n\n\n// but from the Query created by joining with TeamPlayer\n\n\nfinal\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nTeam\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nwhere\n((\nt\n)\n \n=\n \nt\n.\nid\n).\nequalTo\n(\n1\n)\n\n  \n..\njoin\n(\nset\n:\n \n(\nt\n)\n \n=\n \nt\n.\nteamPlayers\n).\njoin\n(\nobject:\n \n(\ntp\n)\n \n=\n \ntp\n.\nplayer\n);\n\n\nfinal\n \nteam\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nquery\n.\nfetchOne\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe structure of this object is:\n\n\n{\n\n  \nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n  \nname\n:\n \nBadgers\n,\n\n  \nteamPlayers\n:\n \n[\n\n    \n{\n\n      \nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n      \nteam\n:\n \n{\n\n        \nid\n:\n \n1\n\n      \n},\n\n      \nplayer\n:\n \n{\n\n        \nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n        \nname\n:\n \nFred\n\n      \n}\n\n    \n}\n\n  \n]\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can flatten this structure in a number of ways.

            "text": "In your application, you declare types whose instances are stored in a database. Each of these types is mapped to a database table, where each property of the type is a column of the table. For example, consider modeling newspaper articles, where each article has a unique identifier, text contents and published date:  // This is a table definition of an  article  class   _Article   { \n   @ Column ( primaryKey:   true ) \n   int   id ; \n\n   String   contents ; \n\n   @ Column ( indexed:   true ) \n   DateTime   publishedDate ;  }   This plain Dart class is called a  table definition  because it defines a database table named  _Article . The table has three columns,  id ,  contents ,  publishedDate . An example of the data stored in this table might look like this:     id  contents  publishedDate      1  Today, the local...  2018-02-01 00:00:00.000    2  In other news, ...  2018-03-01 04:30:00.000     A property in a table definition can optionally have a  Column  annotation. This annotation configures the behavior of the associated database column. If a property doesn't have an annotation, the column has default behavior. These behaviors are shown in the table below:     Option  Type  Behavior  Default      primaryKey  bool  sets primary key column  false (not primary key)    databaseType  ManagedPropertyType  sets underlying column type  inferred from Dart type    nullable  bool  toggles whether column can be null  false (not nullable)    unique  bool  toggles whether column is unique across all rows  false (not unique)    defaultValue  String  provides default value for new rows when value is undefined  null    indexed  bool  whether an index should be created for the column  false (no index)    omitByDefault  bool  whether this column should be fetched by default  true (fetch column value)    autoincrement  bool  whether this column's value is automatically generated from a series  false (not generated)     You must use either zero or one  Column  annotation per property, and you must set all behaviors in one annotation, e.g.:  @ Column ( nullable:   true ,   unique:   true ,   indexed:   true )  int   field ;   The data type of a column is inferred from the Dart type of the property as shown by the following table.     Dart Type  General Column Type  PostgreSQL Column Type      int  integer number  INT  or  SERIAL    double  floating point number  DOUBLE PRECISION    String  text  TEXT    DateTime  timestamp  TIMESTAMP    bool  boolean  BOOLEAN    Document  a JSON object or array  JSONB    Any  enum  text, restricted to enum cases  TEXT     Some types can be represented by many database types; for example, an integer can be stored as 2, 4 or 8 bytes. Use the  databaseType  of a  Column  annotation to specify:  @ Column ( databaseType:   ManagedType . bigInteger )  int   bigNumber ;   The only requirement of a table definition type is that it has exactly one primary key property. A primary key is an indexed, unique identifier for a database row and is set through the  Column  annotation.  @ Column ( primaryKey:   true )  int   id ;   A primary key can be any supported data type, and it is always unique and indexed. It is common for primary keys to be 64-bit, auto-incrementing integers. The  primaryKey  constant exists as a convenience for a  Column  with these behaviors.  class   _Article   { \n   @ primaryKey   // equivalent to @Column(primaryKey: true, databaseType: ManagedType.bigInteger, autoincrement: true) \n   int   id ; \n\n   ...  }    Creating Tables  Tables are created in a database by using the  aqueduct  command line tool to generate and execute migration scripts. The tool inspects your database types and automatically synchronizes a databases schema to match your them.   By default, the name of the table definition is the name of the database table. You can configure this with the  Table  annotation.  @ Table ( name:   ArticleTable )  class   _Article   { \n   @ primaryKey \n   int   id ; \n\n   String   contents ; \n\n   @ Column ( indexed:   true ) \n   DateTime   publishedDate ;  }   It is convention that table definitions are  private classes , that is, their name is prefixed with an underscore ( _ ). This convention is discussed later in this guide.",

For example, when you fetch rows from a database, you will get a list of managed objects. A managed object subclass declares its table definition in two places: once as the type argument of its superclass, and again as an interface it implements.  A managed object subclass inherits all of the properties from its table definition; i.e., an  Article  has an  id ,  contents  and  publishedDate  because  _Article  declares those properties.

            "location": "/db/modeling_data/#modeling-relationships", 
            "text": "A managed object can have  relationships  to other managed objects. For example, an author can have many books, an article can belong to a newspaper, and an employee can have a manager. In a relational database, relationships between tables are established by storing the primary key of a table row in a column of the related table. This column is a  foreign key reference  to the related table.  When a table has a foreign key reference, it is said to  belong to  the related table. In the example of an employee and manager, the employee  belongs to  the manager and therefore the employee table has a foreign key reference to the manager table. The inverse of this statement is also true: a manager  has  employees. A manager has-many employees - this is called a  has-many relationship . There are also  has-one relationships  - for example, a country has-one capital.  The following is an example of a country and a has-one relationship to a capital city:  class   City   extends   ManagedObject _City   implements   _City   {}  class   _City   { \n   @ primaryKey \n   int   id ; \n\n   @ Relate ( # capital ) \n   Country   country ;  }  class   Country   extends   ManagedObject _Country   implements   _Country   {}  class   _Country   { \n   @ primaryKey \n   int   id ; \n\n   City   capital ;  }   A relationship is formed between two tables by declaring properties in both table definition types. The type of those properties is the related managed object subclass - so a  Country  has a property of type  City , and a  City  has a property of type  Country .  Exactly one of those properties must have a  Relate  annotation. The  Relate  annotation designates the underlying column as a foreign key column. In this example, the city table has a foreign key column to the country table. Conceptually, then, a city  belongs to  a country and a country has-one capital city. A city can only belong to one country through this relationship, and that is true of all belongs-to relationship properties.   Foreign Key Column Names  A foreign key column in the database is named by joining the name of the relationship property and the primary key of the related table with an underscore. For example, the column in the city table is named  country_id .   The property without  Relate  is the  inverse  of the relationship and is conceptually either a has-one or has-many relationship property. In this example, a country's relationship to its capital is has-one. A relationship is has-many when the type of the inverse property is a  ManagedSet . For example, if we wanted to model a relationship between a country and all of its cities, we'd declare a  ManagedSet City  property in the country:  class   City   extends   ManagedObject _City   implements   _City   {}  class   _City   { \n   ... \n\n   @ Relate ( # cities ) \n   Country   country ;  }  class   Country   extends   ManagedObject _Country   implements   _Country   {}  class   _Country   { \n   ... \n\n   ManagedSet City   cities ;  }    ManagedSet Behavior  A  Relate  property can never be a  ManagedSet . A  ManagedSet  is a  List , and therefore can be used in the same way a list is used.   Notice that the  Relate  annotation takes at least one argument: a symbol that matches the name of the inverse property. This is what links two relationship properties to each other. In the first example, this argument was  #capital  because the name of the inverse property is  capital ; likewise,  #cities  and  cities . This pairing name must match or an error will be thrown.   Symbols  A symbol is a name identifier in Dart; a symbol can refer to a class, method, or property. The  #name  syntax is a  symbol literal .   The  Relate  annotation has optional arguments to further define the relationship. Like  Column , these are optional arguments, e.g.:  @ Relate ( # cities ,   isRequired:   true ,   rule:   DeleteRule . cascade )   A relationship may be be required or optional. For example, if  City.country  were required, than an  City  must always have an  Country . By default, relationships are optional.  A relationship has a delete rule. When an object is deleted, any objects that belong to its relationships are subject to this rule. The following table shows the rules and their behavior:     Rule  Behavior  Example      nullify (default)  inverse is set to null  When deleting an author, its articles' author becomes null    cascade  related objects are also deleted  When deleting an author, its articles are deleted    restrict  delete fails  When attempting to delete an author with articles, the delete operation fails    default  inverse set to a default value  When deleting an author, its articles author is set to the default value of the column",

For example, consider an  Author  type that stores first and last name as separate columns. Instead of redundantly storing a 'full name' in the database, a transient property can combine the first and last name:  class   Author   extends   ManagedObject _Author   implements   _Author   { \n   String   get   name   =   $ firstName   $ lastName ; \n   set   name ( String   fullName )   { \n     firstName   =   fullName . split (   ). first ; \n     lastName   =   fullName . split (   ). last ; \n   }  }  class   _Author   { \n   @ primaryKey \n   int   id ; \n\n   String   firstName ; \n   String   lastName ;  }   By default, a transient property is ignored when reading an object from a request body or writing the object to a response body (see the guide on  serialization  for more details). You can annotate a transient property with  Serialize  so that it is able to be read from a request body, written to a response body, or both. For example:  class   Author   extends   ManagedObject _Author   implements   _Author   { \n   @ Serialize () \n   String   get   name   =   $ firstName   $ lastName ; \n\n   @ Serialize () \n   set   name ( String   fullName )   { \n     firstName   =   fullName . split (   ). first ; \n     lastName   =   fullName . split (   ). last ; \n   }  }   You may declare getters, setters and properties to be serialized in this way. When declaring a property, you can control it with arguments to  Serialize :  class   Author   extends   ManagedObject _Author   implements   _Author   { \n   @ Serialize ( input:   false ,   output:   true ) \n   bool   isCurrentlyPromoted ;  }",

If a value is not the correct type for the property it is being assigned to, the same exception (with a different error message) is thrown.\n\n\nTo encode a map into a managed object is converted, use the instance method \nasMap\n:\n\n\nfinal\n \nobject\n \n=\n \nMyManagedObject\n();\n\n\nfinal\n \nmap\n \n=\n \nobject\n.\nasMap\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting map will contain the values set on the managed object for keys that match the name of the property.\n\n\nThe values of a \nMap\n equivalent of a managed object are always primitive values that can be encoded as JSON, sent across an isolate, etc. The following shows a table of the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDart Type\n\n\nSerialized Type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nint\n\n\nnumber (\nint\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nnumber (\ndouble\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nString\n\n\nstring (\nString\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDateTime\n\n\nISO 8601 Timestamp (\nString\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbool\n\n\nboolean (\nbool\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument\n\n\nmap or list (\nMap\nString, dynamic\n or \nList\ndynamic\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny \nenum\n\n\nstring (\nString\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelongs-To or Has-One Relationship\n\n\nmap (\nMap\nString, dynamic\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHas-Many Relationship\n\n\nlist of maps (\nList\nMap\nString, dynamic\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth \nasMap\n and \nreadFromMap\n are inherited methods from \nSerializable\n.

For example, when you create a new instance of a managed object, none of its values are available (the object is empty). When encoding an object into a map, only the available values are included and the keys for any unavailable properties are omitted:\n\n\nfinal\n \nmyObject\n \n=\n \nMyManagedObject\n();\n \n// empty object\n\n\nmyObject\n.\nasMap\n()\n \n==\n \n{};\n \n// true\n\n\n\nmyObject\n.\nid\n \n=\n \n1\n;\n\n\nmyObject\n.\nasMap\n()\n \n==\n \n{\n\n  \nid\n:\n \n1\n\n\n};\n \n// true\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA value in managed object's \nasMap\n will only be null if the property value truly is null:\n\n\nmyObject\n.\nid\n \n=\n \nnull\n;\n\n\nmyObject\n.\nasMap\n()\n \n==\n \n{\n\n  \nid\n:\n \nnull\n\n\n};\n \n// true\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA property value becomes available when it is set through an accessor of the object, when invoking \nreadFromMap\n with a map that contains the associated key, or when using a fetch \nQuery\n that fetches the associated column.\n\n\nBehavior of Transient Properties\n\n\nBy default, transient properties - those declared in the managed object subclass, not the table definition - are \nnot\n included in an object's \nasMap()\n. The \nSerialize\n annotation allows a transient property to be included in this map.\n\n\nclass\n \nEmployee\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_Employee\n \nimplements\n \n_Employee\n \n{\n\n  \nint\n \na\n;\n \n// NOT included in asMap, NOT read in readFromMap\n\n\n  \n@\nSerialize\n()\n\n  \nint\n \nb\n;\n \n// included in asMap, read in readFromMap\n\n\n  \n@\nSerialize\n(\ninput:\n \ntrue\n,\n \noutput:\n \nfalse\n)\n\n  \nint\n \nc\n;\n \n// NOT included in asMap, read in readFromMap\n\n\n  \n@\nSerialize\n(\ninput:\n \nfalse\n,\n \noutput:\n \ntrue\n)\n\n  \nint\n \nd\n;\n \n// included in asMap, NOT read in readFromMap\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nclass\n \n_Employee\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nprimaryKey\n\n  \nint\n \nid\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA separate getter and setter may exist instead of a property. Getters with the \nSerialize\n annotation will be written in \nasMap\n and setters with the annotation will be read in \nreadFromMap\n.\n\n\nclass\n \nUser\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_User\n \nimplements\n \n_User\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nSerialize\n()\n\n  \nset\n \ntransientValue\n(\nString\n \ns\n)\n \n{\n\n    \n...\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \n@\nSerialize\n()\n\n  \nString\n \nget\n \ntransientValue\n \n=\n \n...;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA transient property's key will not be present in \nasMap()\n if its value is null.\n\n\nBehavior of Relationship Properties\n\n\nWhen a managed object is encoded, relationship properties are represented as maps (for belongs-to or has-one relationships) or a list of maps (for has-many relationships). The same rules for property availability apply to relationship properties. The following shows an example map that mirrors a managed object with aptly named relationship properties:\n\n\n{\n\n  \nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n  \nbelongsTo\n:\n \n{\n\n    \nid\n:\n \n1\n\n  \n},\n\n  \nhasOne\n:\n \n{\n\n    \nid\n:\n \n2\n,\n\n    \nname\n:\n \nFred\n\n  \n},\n\n  \nhasMany\n:\n \n[\n\n    \n{\nid\n:\n \n3\n,\n \nname\n:\n \nBob\n},\n\n    \n{\nid\n:\n \n4\n,\n \nname\n:\n \nJoe\n},\n\n  \n]\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA belongs-to relationship is \nalways\n a map. This is important for client applications that will often create or update an object's belongs-to relationships. For example, a client wishing to create a child named Timmy with the parent that has \nid == 1\n would send the following JSON:\n\n\n{\n\n  \nname\n:\n \nTimmy\n,\n\n  \nparent\n:\n \n{\n\n    \nid\n:\n \n1\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is different from some frameworks that would flatten this structure, e.g.:\n\n\n{\n\n  \nname\n:\n \nTimmy\n,\n\n  \nparent_id\n:\n \n1\n\n\n}",

            "text": "When a managed object is encoded, relationship properties are represented as maps (for belongs-to or has-one relationships) or a list of maps (for has-many relationships). The same rules for property availability apply to relationship properties. The following shows an example map that mirrors a managed object with aptly named relationship properties:  { \n   id :   1 , \n   belongsTo :   { \n     id :   1 \n   }, \n   hasOne :   { \n     id :   2 , \n     name :   Fred \n   }, \n   hasMany :   [ \n     { id :   3 ,   name :   Bob }, \n     { id :   4 ,   name :   Joe }, \n   ]  }   A belongs-to relationship is  always  a map. This is important for client applications that will often create or update an object's belongs-to relationships. For example, a client wishing to create a child named Timmy with the parent that has  id == 1  would send the following JSON:  { \n   name :   Timmy , \n   parent :   { \n     id :   1 \n   }  }   This is different from some frameworks that would flatten this structure, e.g.:  { \n   name :   Timmy , \n   parent_id :   1  }",

You can configure individual properties of \nvalues\n, or you can assign \nvalues\n to an instance you have created elsewhere:\n\n\nfinal\n \nuserValues\n \n=\n \nUser\n()\n\n  \n..\nname\n \n=\n \nBob\n\n  \n..\nemail\n \n=\n \nbob@stablekernel.com\n;\n\n\nfinal\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nUser\n(\ncontext\n)..\nvalues\n \n=\n \nuserValues\n;\n\n\nfinal\n \nuser\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nquery\n.\ninsert\n();\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nEither way, this query is translated into the following SQL:\n\n\nINSERT\n \nINTO\n \n_user\n \n(\nname\n,\n \nemail\n)\n \nVALUES\n \n(\nBob\n,\n \nbob@stablekernel.com\n)\n \nRETURNING\n \nid\n,\n \nname\n,\n \nemail\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that only the values set on the \nvalues\n object are included in the SQL INSERT query. In this example, both \nname\n and \nemail\n were set, but not \nid\n and therefore only \nname\n and \nemail\n were included in the query. (In this case, the primary key is auto-incrementing and the database will generate it.)\n\n\nValues that are explicitly set to \nnull\n will be sent as \nNULL\n. For example, consider the following \nQuery\nT\n and its SQL:\n\n\nvar\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nUser\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nvalues\n.\nname\n \n=\n \nnull\n\n  \n..\nemail\n \n=\n \nbob@stablekernel.com\n;\n\n\n\n// INSERT INTO _user (name, email) VALUES (NULL, \nbob@stablekernel.com\n) RETURNING id, name, email;\n\n\nawait\n \nquery\n.\ninsert\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn insert query will return a managed object that represents the row that is inserted.\n\n\n\n\nPrefer the Inserted Object\n\n\nAfter you insert an object, you should prefer to use the object returned by an insert query rather than the values you used to populate the query. The object returned from the query will be an accurate representation of the database row, while the object used to build the query may be incomplete or different. For example, an auto-incrementing primary key won't be available in your query-building instance, but will in the object returned from the successful query.\n\n\n\n\nThere is one difference to note when choosing between assigning an instance to \nvalues\n, or configuring the properties of \nvalues\n. In an instance you create, a relationship property must be instantiated before accessing its properties. When accessing the relationship properties of \nvalues\n, an empty instance of the related object is created immediately upon access.\n\n\nfinal\n \nemployee\n \n=\n \nEmployee\n()\n\n  \n..\nmanager\n.\nid\n \n=\n \n1\n;\n \n// this is a null pointer exception because manager is null\n\n\n\nfinal\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nEmployee\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nvalues\n.\nmanager\n.\nid\n \n=\n \n1\n;\n \n// this is OK because of special behavior of Query\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you assign an object to \nvalues\n, it will adopt the behavior of \nvalues\n and instantiate relationships when accessed. Also note that after assigning an object to \nvalues\n, changes to the original object are not reflected in \nvalues\n. In other words, the object is copied instead of referenced.\n\n\nFor simple insertions and for inserting more than one object, you can use the methods on the context:\n\n\nfinal\n \ncontext\n \n=\n \nManagedContext\n(...);\n\n\nfinal\n \nbob\n \n=\n \nUser\n()..\nname\n \n=\n \nBob\n;\n\n\nfinal\n \njay\n \n=\n \nUser\n()..\nname\n \n=\n \nJay\n;\n\n\n\nfinal\n \ninsertedObject\n \n=\n \nawait\n \ncontext\n.\ninsertObject\n(\nbob\n);\n\n\nfinal\n \ninsertedObjects\n \n=\n \nawait\n \ncontext\n.\ninsertObjects\n([\nbob\n,\n \njay\n]);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Data with a Query\n\n\nUpdating rows with a \nQuery\nT\n is similar to inserting data: you set the \nQuery.values\n for properties you want to change. The type parameter for the \nQuery\nT\n indicates which database table will get updated when the query is executed.\n\n\nAn update query can - and likely should - be restricted to a single row or subset of rows. This is done by configuring the \nQuery.where\n property - which gets translated into the \nwhere clause\n of the SQL command. Here's an example:\n\n\n// A Query that will change any user\ns whose name is \nBob\n to \nFred\n\n\nvar\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nUser\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nvalues\n.\nname\n \n=\n \nFred\n\n  \n..\nwhere\n((\nu\n)\n \n=\n \nu\n.\nname\n).\nequalTo\n(\nBob\n);\n\n\n\nList\nUser\n \nbobsThatAreNowFreds\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nquery\n.\nupdate\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike \nvalues\n, \nwhere\n is also the same managed object type the query is being executed on. In the above example, then, both \nvalues\n and \nwhere\n and instances of \nUser\n. This query executes the following SQL:\n\n\nUPDATE\n \n_user\n \nSET\n \nname\n=\nFred\n \nWHERE\n \nname\n=\nBob\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nwhere\n property is a very powerful and flexible, and so there is an entire section dedicated to it later in this guide. For now, we'll stick to some of the things specific to \nupdate()\n.\n\n\nLike \ninsert()\n, only the values set in the \nvalues\n property of a query get updated when executing \nupdate()\n. Values that are omitted are not included. Values that need to be set to \nnull\n must explicitly be set to \nnull\n in the query:\n\n\n// A Query that will remove names from anyone currently named Bob.\n\n\nvar\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nUser\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nvalues\n.\nname\n \n=\n \nnull\n\n  \n..\nwhere\n((\nu\n)\n \n=\n \nu\n.\nname\n).\nequalTo\n(\nBob\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn update query returns every modified row as a result. If no rows are updated, the return value is an empty list.  \n\n\nThere is a variant to \nQuery\nT\n.update\n named \nupdateOne\n. The \nupdateOne\n method will build and execute a SQL query in the same way a normal \nupdate\n does, however, it will only return the single instance that was updated instead of a list. This is convenience method for the caller to get back a single instance instead of a list:\n\n\n// Update user with id = 1 to have the name \nFred\n\n\nvar\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nUser\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nvalues\n.\nname\n \n=\n \nFred\n\n  \n..\nwhere\n((\nu\n)\n \n=\n \nu\n.\nid\n).\nequalTo\n(\n1\n);\n\n\n\nvar\n \nupdatedUser\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nquery\n.\nupdateOne\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nupdateOne\n method will return \nnull\n if no rows were updated. It is important to note that if \nupdateOne\n is used and more than one row is updated, \nupdateOne\n will throw an exception and the changes to the data \nare not reversible\n. Because this is likely a mistake, this is considered an error, hence the exception is thrown. It is up to the programmer to recognize whether or not a particular \nupdateOne\n query would impact multiple rows.\n\n\nUpdate queries have a safety feature that prevents you from accidentally updating every row. If you try to execute a \nQuery\nT\n to do an update without configuring \nwhere\n, an exception is thrown prior to carrying out the request. If you actually want to update every row of a table, you must set the \nQuery.canModifyAllInstances\n to \ntrue\n prior to execution. (This property defaults to \nfalse\n.)\n\n\nDeleting Data with a Query\n\n\nA \nQuery\nT\n will delete rows from a database when using \ndelete()\n. Like update queries, you should specify a row or rows using \nwhere\n properties of the \nQuery\nT\n. The result of a delete operation will be a \nFuture\nint\n with the number of rows deleted.\n\n\nvar\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nUser\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nwhere\n((\nu\n)\n \n=\n \nu\n.\nid\n).\nequalTo\n(\n1\n);\n\n\n\nint\n \nusersDeleted\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nquery\n.\ndelete\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso like update queries, delete queries have a safety feature that prevents you from accidentally deleting every row in a table with \ncanModifyAllInstances\n.\n\n\nAny properties set in the query's \nvalues\n are ignored when executing a delete.\n\n\nFetching Data with a Query\n\n\nOf the four basic operations of a \nQuery\nT\n, fetching data is the most configurable. A simple \nQuery\nT\n that would fetch every instance of some entity looks like this:\n\n\nvar\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nUser\n(\ncontext\n);\n\n\n\nList\nUser\n \nallUsers\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nquery\n.\nfetch\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFetch queries can be limited to a number of instances with the \nfetchLimit\n property. You may also set the \noffset\n of a \nQuery\nT\n to skip the first \noffset\n number of rows. Between \nfetchLimit\n and \noffset\n, you can implement naive paging. However, this type of paging suffers from a number of problems and so there is another paging mechanism covered in later sections.\n\n\nA fetch \nQuery\nT\n uses its \nwhere\n property to filter the result set, just like delete and update queries. The \nvalues\n of a query are ignored when fetching objects. You may also fetch a single instance with \nfetchOne\n. If no instance is found, \nnull\n is returned. Only use this method when the search criteria is guaranteed to be unique.\n\n\nvar\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nUser\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nwhere\n((\nu\n)\n \n=\n \nu\n.\nid\n).\nequalTo\n(\n1\n);\n\n\n\nUser\n \noneUser\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nquery\n.\nfetchOne\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you are fetching an object by its primary key, you can use a shorthand method \nManagedContext.fetchObjectWithID\n. The method must be able to infer the type of the object, or you must provide it:\n\n\nfinal\n \nobject\n \n=\n \nawait\n \ncontext\n.\nfetchObjectWithID\nUser\n(\n1\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSorting\n\n\nResults of a fetch can be sorted using the \nsortBy\n method of a \nQuery\nT\n. Here's an example:\n\n\nvar\n \nq\n \n=\n \nQuery\nUser\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nsortBy\n((\nu\n)\n \n=\n \nu\n.\ndateCreated\n,\n \nQuerySortOrder\n.\nascending\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsortBy\n takes two arguments: a closure that returns which property to sort by and the order of the sort.\n\n\nA \nQuery\nT\n results can be sorted by multiple properties. When multiple \nsortBy\ns are invoked on a \nQuery\nT\n, later \nsortBy\ns are used to break ties in previous \nsortBy\ns. For example, the following query will sort by last name, then by first name:\n\n\nvar\n \nq\n \n=\n \nQuery\nUser\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nsortBy\n((\nu\n)\n \n=\n \nu\n.\nlastName\n,\n \nQuerySortOrder\n.\nascending\n)\n\n  \n..\nsortBy\n((\nu\n)\n \n=\n \nu\n.\nfirstName\n,\n \nQuerySortOrder\n.\nascending\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, the following three names would be ordered like so: 'Sally Smith', 'John Wu', 'Sally Wu'.\n\n\nProperty Selectors\n\n\nIn the section on sorting, you saw the use of a \nproperty selector\n to select the property of the user to sort by. This syntax is used for many other query manipulations, like filtering and joining. A property selector is a closure that gives you an object of the type you are querying and must return a property of that object. The selector \n(u) =\n u.lastName\n in the previous section is a property selector that selects the last name of a user.\n\n\nThe Dart analyzer will infer that the argument of a property selector, and it is always the same type as the object being queried. This enables IDE auto-completion, static error checking, and other tools like project-wide renaming.\n\n\n\n\nLive Templates\n\n\nTo speed up query building, create a Live Template in IntelliJ that generates a property selector when typing 'ps'. The source of the template is \n(o) =\n o.$END$\n. A downloadable settings configuration for IntelliJ exists \nhere\n that includes this shortcut.\n\n\n\n\nSpecifying Result Properties\n\n\nWhen executing queries that return managed objects (i.e., \ninsert()\n, \nupdate()\n and \nfetch()\n), the default properties for each object are fetched. The default properties of a managed object are properties that correspond to a database column - attributes declared in the table definition. A managed object's default properties can be modified when declaring its table definition:\n\n\nclass\n \n_User\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nColumn\n(\nomitByDefault:\n \ntrue\n)\n\n  \nString\n \nhashedPassword\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny property with \nomitByDefault\n set to true will not be fetched by default.\n\n\nA property that is \nomitByDefault\n can still be fetched. Likewise, a property that is in the defaults can still be omitted. Each \nQuery\nT\n has a \nreturningProperties\n method to adjust which properties do get returned from the query. Its usage looks like this:\n\n\nvar\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nUser\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nreturningProperties\n((\nuser\n)\n \n=\n \n[\nuser\n.\nid\n,\n \nuser\n.\nname\n]);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreturningProperties\n is a multiple property selector - instead of returning just one property, it returns a list of properties.\n\n\nYou may include 'belongs-to' relationships in \nreturningProperties\n, but you may not include 'has-many' or 'has-one' relationships. An exception will be thrown if you attempt to. To include properties from relationships like these, see \njoin in Advanced Queries\n.\n\n\nNote that if you omit the primary key of a managed object from \nreturningProperties\n, it will automatically be added. The primary key is necessary to transform the rows into instances of their \nManagedObject\nT\n subclass.\n\n\nExceptions and Errors\n\n\nWhen executing a query, it may fail for any number of reasons: the query is invalid, a database couldn't be reached, constraints were violated, etc. In many cases, this exception originates from the underlying database driver. When thrown in a controller, these exceptions will trigger a 500 Server Error response.\n\n\nExceptions that are thrown in response to user input (e.g., violating a database constraint, invalid data type) are re-interpreted into a \nQueryException\n or \nValidationException\n. Both of these exception types have an associated \nResponse\n object that is sent instead of the default 500 Server error.\n\n\nFor this reason, you don't need to catch database query exceptions in a controller; an appropriate response will be sent on your behalf.\n\n\nStatement Reuse\n\n\nAqueduct will parameterize and reuse queries when possible. This allows for significant speed and security improvements. Note that you do not have to do anything special to take advantage of this feature. However, currently at this time, you may not disable this feature.",

            "text": "Updating rows with a  Query T  is similar to inserting data: you set the  Query.values  for properties you want to change. The type parameter for the  Query T  indicates which database table will get updated when the query is executed.  An update query can - and likely should - be restricted to a single row or subset of rows. This is done by configuring the  Query.where  property - which gets translated into the  where clause  of the SQL command. Here's an example:  // A Query that will change any user s whose name is  Bob  to  Fred  var   query   =   Query User ( context ) \n   .. values . name   =   Fred \n   .. where (( u )   =   u . name ). equalTo ( Bob );  List User   bobsThatAreNowFreds   =   await   query . update ();   Like  values ,  where  is also the same managed object type the query is being executed on. In the above example, then, both  values  and  where  and instances of  User . This query executes the following SQL:  UPDATE   _user   SET   name = Fred   WHERE   name = Bob ;   The  where  property is a very powerful and flexible, and so there is an entire section dedicated to it later in this guide. For now, we'll stick to some of the things specific to  update() .  Like  insert() , only the values set in the  values  property of a query get updated when executing  update() . Values that are omitted are not included. Values that need to be set to  null  must explicitly be set to  null  in the query:  // A Query that will remove names from anyone currently named Bob.  var   query   =   Query User ( context ) \n   .. values . name   =   null \n   .. where (( u )   =   u . name ). equalTo ( Bob );   An update query returns every modified row as a result. If no rows are updated, the return value is an empty list.    There is a variant to  Query T .update  named  updateOne . The  updateOne  method will build and execute a SQL query in the same way a normal  update  does, however, it will only return the single instance that was updated instead of a list. This is convenience method for the caller to get back a single instance instead of a list:  // Update user with id = 1 to have the name  Fred  var   query   =   Query User ( context ) \n   .. values . name   =   Fred \n   .. where (( u )   =   u . id ). equalTo ( 1 );  var   updatedUser   =   await   query . updateOne ();   The  updateOne  method will return  null  if no rows were updated. It is important to note that if  updateOne  is used and more than one row is updated,  updateOne  will throw an exception and the changes to the data  are not reversible . Because this is likely a mistake, this is considered an error, hence the exception is thrown. It is up to the programmer to recognize whether or not a particular  updateOne  query would impact multiple rows.  Update queries have a safety feature that prevents you from accidentally updating every row. If you try to execute a  Query T  to do an update without configuring  where , an exception is thrown prior to carrying out the request. If you actually want to update every row of a table, you must set the  Query.canModifyAllInstances  to  true  prior to execution. (This property defaults to  false .)",

You may also set the  offset  of a  Query T  to skip the first  offset  number of rows. Between  fetchLimit  and  offset , you can implement naive paging.

A fetch  Query T  uses its  where  property to filter the result set, just like delete and update queries. The  values  of a query are ignored when fetching objects.

            "text": "Advanced Queries: Filtering, Joins, Paging and Reduce\n\n\nPaging Fetched Result Sets\n\n\nThe rows from a table can be sorted and fetched in contiguous chunks. This sorting can occur on most properties. For example, in a social media application, a user could have thousands of pieces of content they had created over many years. The likely use case for fetching their content would be to grab only the most recent content, and only grab earlier content as necessary. Aqueduct has two mechanisms in \nQuery\nT\n for building queries that can fetch a subset of rows within a certain range.\n\n\nNaive paging can be accomplished using the \nfetchLimit\n and \noffset\n properties of a \nQuery\nT\n. For example, if a table contains 100 rows, and you would like to grab 10 at a time, each query would have a value of 10 for its \nfetchLimit\n. The first query would have an \noffset\n of 0, then 10, then 20, and so on. Especially when using \nsortBy\n, this type of paging can be effective. One of the drawbacks to this type of paging is that it can skip or duplicate rows if rows are being added or deleted between fetches.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, consider the seven objects above that are ordered by time. If we page by two objects at a time (\nfetchLimit=2\n) starting at the first item (\noffset=0\n), our first result set is the first two objects. The next page is the original offset plus the same limit - we grab the next two rows. But before the next page is fetched, a new object is inserted and its at an index that we already fetched. The next page would return \n3:00pm\n again. A similar problem occurs if a row is deleted when paging in this way.\n\n\nIt is really annoying for client applications to have to check for and merge duplicates. Another paging technique that doesn't suffer from this problem relies on the client sending a value from the last object in the previous page, instead of an offset. So in the above example, instead of asking for offset 2 in the second query, it'd send the value \n1:30pm\n. The query filters out rows with a value less than the one it was sent, orders the remaining rows and then fetches the newest from the top.\n\n\nQuery.pageBy\n uses this technique. Its usage is similar to \nsortBy\n:\n\n\nvar\n \nfirstQuery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nPost\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\npageBy\n((\np\n)\n \n=\n \np\n.\ndateCreated\n,\n \nQuerySortOrder\n.\ndescending\n)\n\n  \n..\nfetchLimit\n \n=\n \n10\n;\n\n\n\nvar\n \nfirstQueryResults\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nfirstQuery\n.\nfetch\n();\n\n\n\nvar\n \noldestPostWeGot\n \n=\n \nfirstQueryResults\n.\nlast\n.\ndateCreated\n;\n\n\nvar\n \nnextQuery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nPost\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\npageBy\n((\np\n)\n \n=\n \np\n.\ndateCreated\n,\n \nQuerySortOrder\n.\ndescending\n,\n \nboundingValue:\n \noldestPostWeGot\n)\n\n  \n..\nfetchLimit\n \n=\n \n10\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis query would fetch the newest 10 posts. Then, it fetches the next 10 after skipping past all of the ones newer than the oldest post it got in the first result set.\n\n\nWhen paging, the query must have a \nfetchLimit\n - otherwise you're just sorting and returning every row. You identify which property to page on by using a property selector. The second argument to \npageBy\n defines the order the rows will be sorted in.\n\n\nWhen you first start paging, you don't have any results yet, so you can't specify a value from the last result set. In this case, the \nboundingValue\n of \npageBy\n is null - meaning start from the beginning. Once the first set has been fetched, the \nboundingValue\n is the value of the paging property in the last object returned.\n\n\nThis is often accomplished by adding a query parameter to an endpoint that takes in a bounding value. (See \nManagedObjectController\nT\n as an example.)\n\n\nA \npageBy\n query will return an empty list of objects when no more values are left. If the number of objects remaining in the last page are less than the \nfetchLimit\n, only those objects will be returned. For example, if there four more objects left and the \nfetchLimit\n is 10, the number of objects returned will be four.\n\n\nYou should index properties that will be paged by:\n\n\n@\nColumn\n(\nindexed:\n \ntrue\n)\n\n\nint\n \npageableProperty\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiltering Results of a Fetch Operation\n\n\nFetching every row of a table usually doesn't make sense. Instead, we want a specific object or a set of objects matching some criteria.\n\n\nA \nQuery\n's \nwhere\n method is a safe and elegant way to add this criteria to a query. This method allows you to assign boolean expressions to the properties of the object being queried. Each expression is added to the WHERE clause of the generated SQL query. Here's an example of a query that finds a \nUser\n with an \nid\n equal to 1:\n\n\nvar\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nUser\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nwhere\n((\nu\n)\n \n=\n \nu\n.\nid\n).\nequalTo\n(\n1\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(The generated SQL here would be 'SELECT _user.id, _user.name, ... FROM _user WHERE _user.id = 1'.)\n\n\nThere are many expression methods like \nequalTo\n - see the documentation for \nQueryExpression\nT\n for a complete list.\n\n\nYou may add multiple criteria to a query by invoking \nwhere\n multiple times. Each criteria is combined together with a logical 'and'. For example, the following query will find all users whose \nname\n is \"Bob\" \nand\n \nemail\n is not null:\n\n\nfinal\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nUser\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nwhere\n((\nu\n)\n \n=\n \nu\n.\nname\n).\nequalTo\n(\nBob\n)\n\n  \n..\nwhere\n((\nu\n)\n \n=\n \nu\n.\nemail\n).\nisNotNull\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may apply criteria to relationship properties, too. For nullable relationships, you can apply null/not null checks:\n\n\nvar\n \nemployedQuery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nPerson\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nwhere\n((\nc\n)\n \n=\n \nc\n.\ncompany\n).\nisNotNull\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore often, you use the \nidentifiedBy\n expression for finding objects that belong to a specific object. For example, when finding all employees for a given company:\n\n\nvar\n \npreferredQuery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nEmployee\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nwhere\n((\nc\n)\n \n=\n \nc\n.\ncompany\n).\nidentifiedBy\n(\n23\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above will only return employees who work for company with a primary key value of 23. It is equivalent to the following, and both are acceptable:\n\n\nvar\n \nsameQuery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nEmployee\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nwhere\n((\nc\n)\n \n=\n \nc\n.\ncompany\n.\nid\n).\nequalTo\n(\n23\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice in the above that you may select properties of relationships when building a query. Since an employee 'belongs-to' a company, the employee table has a column to store the primary key of a company. This is called a foreign key column. When building a query that selects the primary key of a belongs-to relationship, Aqueduct can interpret this to use the foreign key column value.\n\n\nFor selecting properties that are not backed by a foreign key column in the table being queried, see the next section on Joins.\n\n\nIncluding Relationships in a Fetch (aka, Joins)\n\n\nA \nQuery\nT\n can also fetch relationship properties. This allows queries to fetch entire model graphs and reduces the number of round-trips to a database.\n\n\nBy default, relationship properties are not fetched in a query and therefore aren't included in an object's \nasMap()\n. For example, consider the following definitions, where a \nUser\n has-many \nTask\ns:\n\n\nclass\n \nUser\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_User\n \nimplements\n \n_User\n \n{}\n\n\nclass\n \n_User\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nprimaryKey\n\n  \nint\n \nid\n;\n\n\n  \nString\n \nname\n;\n\n  \nManagedSet\nTask\n \ntasks\n;\n  \n\n}\n\n\n\nclass\n \nTask\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_Task\n \nimplements\n \n_Task\n \n{}\n\n\nclass\n \n_Task\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nprimaryKey\n\n  \nint\n \nid\n;\n\n\n  \n@\nColumn\n(\n#\ntasks\n)\n\n  \nUser\n \nuser\n;\n\n\n  \nString\n \ncontents\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA \nQuery\nUser\n will fetch the \nname\n and \nid\n of each \nUser\n. A \nUser\n's \ntasks\n are not fetched, so the data returned looks like this:\n\n\nvar\n \nq\n \n=\n \nQuery\nUser\n(\ncontext\n);\n\n\nvar\n \nusers\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nq\n.\nfetch\n();\n\n\n\nusers\n.\nfirst\n.\nasMap\n()\n \n==\n \n{\n\n  \nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n  \nname\n:\n \nBob\n\n\n};\n \n// yup\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \njoin()\n method will tell a query to also include related objects. The following shows a fetch that gets users and their tasks:\n\n\nvar\n \nq\n \n=\n \nQuery\nUser\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\njoin\n(\nset\n:\n \n(\nu\n)\n \n=\n \nu\n.\ntasks\n);\n\n\nvar\n \nusers\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nq\n.\nfetch\n();\n\n\n\nusers\n.\nfirst\n.\nasMap\n()\n \n==\n \n{\n\n  \nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n  \nname\n:\n \nBob\n,\n\n  \ntasks\n:\n \n[\n\n      \n{\nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n \ncontents\n:\n \nTake out trash\n,\n \nuser\n \n:\n \n{\nid\n:\n \n1\n}},\n\n      \n...\n\n  \n]\n\n\n};\n \n// yup\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen joining a has-many relationship, the \nset:\n argument takes a property selector that must select a \nManagedSet\n. (When fetching a has-one or belongs-to relationship, use the \nobject:\n argument.)\n\n\nThe method \njoin()\n returns a new \nQuery\nT\n, where \nT\n is the type of the joined object. That is, the above code could also be written as such:\n\n\nvar\n \nq\n \n=\n \nQuery\nUser\n(\ncontext\n);\n\n\n\n// type annotation added for clarity\n\n\nQuery\nTask\n \ntaskSubQuery\n \n=\n \nq\n.\njoin\n(\nset\n:\n \n(\nu\n)\n \n=\n \nu\n.\ntasks\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring Join Queries\n\n\nYou do not execute a query created by a join, but you do configure it like any other query. (The parent query keeps track of the joined query and you execute the parent query.) For example, you may modify the properties that are returned for the joined objects:\n\n\nvar\n \nq\n \n=\n \nQuery\nUser\n(\ncontext\n);\n\n\n\nq\n.\njoin\n(\nset\n:\n \n(\nu\n)\n \n=\n \nu\n.\ntasks\n)\n  \n  \n..\nreturningProperties\n((\nt\n)\n \n=\n \n[\nt\n.\nid\n,\n \nt\n.\ncontents\n]);\n\n\n\nfinal\n \nusersAndTasks\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nq\n.\nfetch\n();\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also apply filtering criteria to a join query. Consider a \nParent\n that has-many \nChildren\n. When fetching parents and joining their children, a \nwhere\n expression on the join query impacts which children are returned, but does not impact which parents are returned. For example, the following query would fetch every parent, but would only include children who are greater than 1 years old:\n\n\nfinal\n \nq\n \n=\n \nQuery\nParent\n(\ncontext\n);\n\n\nq\n.\njoin\n(\nset\n:\n \n(\np\n)\n \n=\n \np\n.\nchildren\n)\n\n  \n..\nwhere\n((\nc\n)\n \n=\n \nc\n.\nage\n).\ngreaterThan\n(\n1\n);\n\n\n\nfinal\n \nparentsAndTheirChildren\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nq\n.\nfetch\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiltering Objects by Their Relationships\n\n\nHowever, consider if we applied a similar expression to the parent query - it would only return parents \nwho have children that are greater than 1 years old\n.\n\n\nfinal\n \nq\n \n=\n \nQuery\nParent\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nwhere\n((\nc\n)\n \n=\n \nc\n.\nchildren\n.\nhaveAtLeastOneWhere\n.\nage\n).\ngreaterThan\n(\n1\n);\n\n  \n..\njoin\n(\nset\n:\n \n(\np\n)\n \n=\n \np\n.\nchildren\n);\n\n\n\nfinal\n \nparentsWithOlderChildren\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nq\n.\nfetch\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference is where the expression is applied. When applying it to the child query, it removes child objects that don't meet the criteria. When applying it to the parent query, it removes parents that don't meet the criteria. The property \nhaveAtLeastOneWhere\n is specific to has-many relationships. When selecting properties of a has-one or belongs-to relationship, you access the property directly:\n\n\nfinal\n \nq\n \n=\n \nQuery\nChild\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nwhere\n((\np\n)\n \n=\n \np\n.\nparent\n.\nage\n).\ngreaterThan\n(\n30\n)\n\n  \n..\njoin\n(\nobject:\n \n(\np\n)\n \n=\n \ne\n.\nparent\n);\n\n\n\nfinal\n \nchildrenWithParentsOver30\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nq\n.\nfetch\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that you may use relationship properties without explicitly joining the property. A SQL JOIN is still performed, but the related object is not included in the result set.\n\n\nfinal\n \nq\n \n=\n \nQuery\nChild\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nwhere\n((\np\n)\n \n=\n \np\n.\nparent\n.\nage\n).\ngreaterThan\n(\n30\n);\n\n\n\nfinal\n \nemployeesWithManagersOver30YearsOld\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nq\n.\nfetch\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Joins\n\n\nMore than one join can be applied to a query, and subqueries can be nested.

Here's an example:\n\n\nvar\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nUser\n(\ncontext\n);\n\n\nvar\n \nnumberOfUsers\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nquery\n.\nreduce\n.\ncount\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor reduce functions that use the value of some property, a property selector is used to identify that property.\n\n\nvar\n \naverageSalary\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nquery\n.\nreduce\n.\nsum\n((\nu\n)\n \n=\n \nu\n.\nsalary\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny values configured in a \nQuery\nT\n also impact the \nreduce\n function.

Note that the objects returned will be a \nList\nList\ndynamic\n - a list of rows, for each a list of columns.\n\n\nYou may also provide raw WHERE clauses with \nQuery.predicate\n. A \nQueryPredicate\n is a \nString\n that is set as the query's where clause. A \nQueryPredicate\n has two properties, a format string and a \nMap\nString, dynamic\n of parameter values. The \nformat\n string can (and should) parameterize any input values. Parameters are indicated in the format string using the \n@\n token:\n\n\n// Creates a predicate that would only include instances where some column \nid\n is less than 2\n\n\nvar\n \npredicate\n \n=\n \nQueryPredicate\n(\nid \n @idVariable\n,\n \n{\nidVariable\n \n:\n \n2\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe text following the \n@\n token may contain \n[A-Za-z0-9_]\n. The resulting where clause will be formed by replacing each token with the matching key in the parameters map. The value is not transformed in any way, so it must be the appropriate type for the column. If a key is not present in the \nMap\n, an exception will be thrown. Extra keys will be ignored.",

            "text": "The rows from a table can be sorted and fetched in contiguous chunks. This sorting can occur on most properties. For example, in a social media application, a user could have thousands of pieces of content they had created over many years. The likely use case for fetching their content would be to grab only the most recent content, and only grab earlier content as necessary. Aqueduct has two mechanisms in  Query T  for building queries that can fetch a subset of rows within a certain range.  Naive paging can be accomplished using the  fetchLimit  and  offset  properties of a  Query T . For example, if a table contains 100 rows, and you would like to grab 10 at a time, each query would have a value of 10 for its  fetchLimit . The first query would have an  offset  of 0, then 10, then 20, and so on. Especially when using  sortBy , this type of paging can be effective. One of the drawbacks to this type of paging is that it can skip or duplicate rows if rows are being added or deleted between fetches.   For example, consider the seven objects above that are ordered by time. If we page by two objects at a time ( fetchLimit=2 ) starting at the first item ( offset=0 ), our first result set is the first two objects. The next page is the original offset plus the same limit - we grab the next two rows. But before the next page is fetched, a new object is inserted and its at an index that we already fetched. The next page would return  3:00pm  again. A similar problem occurs if a row is deleted when paging in this way.  It is really annoying for client applications to have to check for and merge duplicates. Another paging technique that doesn't suffer from this problem relies on the client sending a value from the last object in the previous page, instead of an offset. So in the above example, instead of asking for offset 2 in the second query, it'd send the value  1:30pm . The query filters out rows with a value less than the one it was sent, orders the remaining rows and then fetches the newest from the top.  Query.pageBy  uses this technique. Its usage is similar to  sortBy :  var   firstQuery   =   Query Post ( context ) \n   .. pageBy (( p )   =   p . dateCreated ,   QuerySortOrder . descending ) \n   .. fetchLimit   =   10 ;  var   firstQueryResults   =   await   firstQuery . fetch ();  var   oldestPostWeGot   =   firstQueryResults . last . dateCreated ;  var   nextQuery   =   Query Post ( context ) \n   .. pageBy (( p )   =   p . dateCreated ,   QuerySortOrder . descending ,   boundingValue:   oldestPostWeGot ) \n   .. fetchLimit   =   10 ;   This query would fetch the newest 10 posts. Then, it fetches the next 10 after skipping past all of the ones newer than the oldest post it got in the first result set.  When paging, the query must have a  fetchLimit  - otherwise you're just sorting and returning every row. You identify which property to page on by using a property selector. The second argument to  pageBy  defines the order the rows will be sorted in.  When you first start paging, you don't have any results yet, so you can't specify a value from the last result set. In this case, the  boundingValue  of  pageBy  is null - meaning start from the beginning. Once the first set has been fetched, the  boundingValue  is the value of the paging property in the last object returned.  This is often accomplished by adding a query parameter to an endpoint that takes in a bounding value. (See  ManagedObjectController T  as an example.)  A  pageBy  query will return an empty list of objects when no more values are left. If the number of objects remaining in the last page are less than the  fetchLimit , only those objects will be returned. For example, if there four more objects left and the  fetchLimit  is 10, the number of objects returned will be four.  You should index properties that will be paged by:  @ Column ( indexed:   true )  int   pageableProperty ;",

            "text": "Fetching every row of a table usually doesn't make sense. Instead, we want a specific object or a set of objects matching some criteria.  A  Query 's  where  method is a safe and elegant way to add this criteria to a query. This method allows you to assign boolean expressions to the properties of the object being queried. Each expression is added to the WHERE clause of the generated SQL query. Here's an example of a query that finds a  User  with an  id  equal to 1:  var   query   =   Query User ( context ) \n   .. where (( u )   =   u . id ). equalTo ( 1 );   (The generated SQL here would be 'SELECT _user.id, _user.name, ... FROM _user WHERE _user.id = 1'.)  There are many expression methods like  equalTo  - see the documentation for  QueryExpression T  for a complete list.  You may add multiple criteria to a query by invoking  where  multiple times. Each criteria is combined together with a logical 'and'. For example, the following query will find all users whose  name  is \"Bob\"  and   email  is not null:  final   query   =   Query User ( context ) \n   .. where (( u )   =   u . name ). equalTo ( Bob ) \n   .. where (( u )   =   u . email ). isNotNull ();   You may apply criteria to relationship properties, too. For nullable relationships, you can apply null/not null checks:  var   employedQuery   =   Query Person ( context ) \n   .. where (( c )   =   c . company ). isNotNull ();   More often, you use the  identifiedBy  expression for finding objects that belong to a specific object. For example, when finding all employees for a given company:  var   preferredQuery   =   Query Employee ( context ) \n   .. where (( c )   =   c . company ). identifiedBy ( 23 );   The above will only return employees who work for company with a primary key value of 23. It is equivalent to the following, and both are acceptable:  var   sameQuery   =   Query Employee ( context ) \n   .. where (( c )   =   c . company . id ). equalTo ( 23 );   Notice in the above that you may select properties of relationships when building a query. Since an employee 'belongs-to' a company, the employee table has a column to store the primary key of a company. This is called a foreign key column. When building a query that selects the primary key of a belongs-to relationship, Aqueduct can interpret this to use the foreign key column value.  For selecting properties that are not backed by a foreign key column in the table being queried, see the next section on Joins.",

Consider a  Parent  that has-many  Children . When fetching parents and joining their children, a  where  expression on the join query impacts which children are returned, but does not impact which parents are returned. For example, the following query would fetch every parent, but would only include children who are greater than 1 years old:  final   q   =   Query Parent ( context );  q . join ( set :   ( p )   =   p . children ) \n   .. where (( c )   =   c . age ). greaterThan ( 1 );  final   parentsAndTheirChildren   =   await   q . fetch ();",

You create transactions by invoking  ManagedContext.transaction  and writing your queries in its closure argument.  await   context . transaction (( transaction )   async   { \n   // note that  transaction  is the context for each of these queries. \n   final   newDepartment   =   await   transaction . insertObject ( Department ().. name   =   New Department ); \n\n   final   changeDepartmentQuery   =   Query Employee ( transaction ) \n     .. where (( e )   =   e . department . id ). oneOf ([ 1 ,   2 ])       \n     .. values . department . id   =   newDepartment . id ; \n   await   changeDepartmentQuery . update (); \n\n   final   deleteDepartmentQuery   =   Query Department ( transaction ) \n     .. where (( e )   =   e . department . id ). oneOf ([ 1 ,   2 ]); \n   await   deleteDepartmentQuery . delete ();        });   The closure has a  transaction  object that all queries in the transaction must use as their context. Queries that use this transaction context will be grouped in the same transaction. Once they have all succeeded, the  transaction  method's future completes. If an exception is thrown in the closure, the transaction is rolled back and the  transaction  method re-throws that exception.   Failing to Use the Transaction Context will Deadlock your Application  If you use the transaction's parent context in a query inside a transaction closure, the database connection will deadlock and will stop working.",

As part of these two operations, a \nManagedObject\nT\n will ensure that its properties have valid values. For example, a \nPerson\n object might ensure that its name starts with a capital letter and that its phone number has only numeric values.  If one or more validation fails, the update or insert operation will fail and the data is not sent to the database. A validation failure will throw a \nQueryException\n that returns an HTTP response with error messaging to help the client correct their request.\n\n\nThe preferred way of setting a validation is to add \nValidate\n metadata to properties of a table definition. Here's an example of a validation that ensures a tweet is less than 140 characters:\n\n\nclass\n \nTweet\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_Tweet\n \nimplements\n \n_Tweet\n \n{}\n\n\nclass\n \n_Tweet\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nprimaryKey\n\n  \nint\n \nid\n;\n\n\n  \n@\nValidate\n.\nlength\n(\nlessThan:\n \n140\n)\n\n  \nString\n \nmessage\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt-in Validators\n\n\nThere are a handful of built-in validations for common operations. For example, it is common to apply a regular expression to a value to ensure it formatted correctly or restrict the possible values to a list of available options. Common validators are available as named constructors f the \nValidate\n class. Here is an example:\n\n\nclass\n \n_Story\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nprimaryKey\n\n  \nint\n \nid\n;\n\n\n  \n@\nValidate\n.\noneOf\n(\nconst\n \n[\nstarted\n,\n \naccepted\n,\n \nrejected\n,\n \ndelivered\n])\n\n  \nString\n \nstate\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA built-in validator is useful because it automatically generates an error message that is returned in an HTTP response. For example, the previous code snippet indicates that the \nstate\n property must be one of the four listed strings. If a value other than one of those four strings is used, the error message returned to the HTTP client would be:\n\n\nThe value `invalidValue` is not valid for `state`. Valid values are: \nstarted\n, \naccepted\n, \nrejected\n, \ndelivered\n.\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the API reference for \nValidate\n and its named constructors for possible options.\n\n\nValidate\n annotations on transient properties have no effect. This annotation is only valid for properties declared in a table definition.\n\n\nCustom Validators\n\n\nThere will be times where the built-in validators are not sufficient for your application's use case. You may create subclasses of \nValidate\n to provide custom validation behavior. For example, if there were a \nValidatePhoneNumber\n class:\n\n\nclass\n \n_Person\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nprimaryKey\n\n  \nint\n \nid\n;\n\n\n  \n@\nValidatePhoneNumber\n()\n\n  \nString\n \nphoneNumber\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA subclass of \nValidate\n must override \nValidate.validate()\n and call the superclass' primary constructor when instantiated. Here's an example of that phone number validator:\n\n\nclass\n \nValidatePhoneNumber\n \nextends\n \nValidate\n \n{\n\n  \nValidatePhoneNumber\n({\nbool\n \nonUpdate:\n \ntrue\n,\n \nbool\n \nonInsert:\n \ntrue\n})\n \n:\n\n    \nsuper\n(\nonUpdate:\n \nonUpdate\n,\n \nonInsert:\n \nonInsert\n);\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nvoid\n \nvalidate\n(\nValidationContext\n \ncontext\n,\n \ndynamic\n \nvalue\n)\n \n{\n  \n    \nif\n \n(\nvalue\n.\nlength\n \n!=\n \n15\n)\n \n{\n\n      \ncontext\n.\naddError\n(\nmust be 15 digits\n);\n      \n    \n}\n\n\n    \nif\n \n(\ncontainsNonNumericValues\n(\nvalue\n))\n \n{\n\n      \ncontext\n.\naddError\n(\nmust contain characters 0-9 only.\n);\n      \n    \n}\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf \nvalue\n is doesn't meet the validation criteria, this method adds an error string to the \nValidationContext\n it is passed. Error messages should be brief and indicate the successful criteria that failed. Information about the property being validated will automatically be added to the error message, so you do not need to include that information. If the context has no errors at the end of validation, the validation succeeds; otherwise, it fails.\n\n\nA \nValidationContext\n also has information about the property being validated, and whether the validation is running for an object being inserted or an object being updated.\n\n\nValidation Behavior\n\n\nA property may have more than one \nValidate\n metadata. In this case, all of the validations for a property must pass. The order in which multiple validations are performed is undefined and subject to change. Here's an example of validations that ensure a property's value is 10 characters long and only contains 10 alphabetic capital letters:\n\n\n@\nValidate\n.\nlength\n(\nequalTo:\n \n10\n)\n\n\n@\nValidate\n.\nmatches\n(\nr\n$[A-Z]+^\n)\n\n\nString\n \ntenCapitalLetters\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, validations are executed when a \nQuery\nT\n's \ninsert\n or \nupdate\n method is invoked. A validator can be restricted to only run on \ninsert\n or \nupdate\n by passing values for its optional constructor arguments \nonUpdate\n and \nonInsert\n:\n\n\n@\nValidate\n.\nmatches\n(\nr\n^[A-Z]+$\n,\n \nonInsert:\n \ntrue\n,\n \nonUpdate:\n \nfalse\n)\n\n\nString\n \nvalidateOnInsertOnly\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to understand how validations work when a value for a property is \nnot\n specified in an insert or update query. For example, consider a \nPerson\n with a \nname\n and \nemail\n property and then inserted in a query where \nemail\n hasn't been set:\n\n\nvar\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nQuery\nPerson\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nvalues\n.\nname\n \n=\n \nBob\n;\n\n\n\nawait\n \nquery\n.\ninsert\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause \nemail\n was not set on \nQuery.values\n, validations will not be run on that property.\n\n\nThere are two special validators that can require a property to be set, or require that a property \nnot\n be set. \nValidate.present()\n requires that the associated property must have a value. A property with this validator must be provided each time the object is inserted or updated. For example, the following declaration requires that \nemail\n is set on insertion, but doesn't have to be for updates:\n\n\n@\nValidate\n.\npresent\n(\nonUpdate:\n \nfalse\n,\n \nonInsert:\n \ntrue\n)\n\n\nString\n \nemail\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inverse of \nValidate.present()\n is \nValidate.absent()\n. This validation prevents a property from being set. This is useful when a value should be included during insertion, but can't be updated. Here's an example:\n\n\n@\nValidate\n.\nabsent\n(\nonUpdate:\n \ntrue\n,\n \nonInsert:\n \nfalse\n)\n\n\nString\n \ncanOnlyBeSetOnce\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above declaration, the validator is only run on update operations and ensures that the property \ncanOnlyBeSetOnce\n does not have a value. Because this validator is not run on insert operations, there is no restriction when the object is first inserted.\n\n\nValidators are not run when a value is null. For example, the following insertion explicitly inserts \nnull\n for the property \nemail\n:\n\n\nvar\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nQuery\nPerson\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nvalues\n.\nemail\n \n=\n \nnull\n\n  \n..\nvalues\n.\nname\n \n=\n \nBob\n;\n\n\n\nawait\n \nquery\n.\ninsert\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNullability is enforced by \nColumn.isNullable\n property. Consider the following declaration:\n\n\n@\nColumn\n(\nnullable:\n \nfalse\n)\n\n\n@\nValidate\n.\nlength\n(\ngreaterThan:\n \n10\n)\n\n\nString\n \nname\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, the property \nname\n must not be null and must be greater than 10 characters long. The behavior of inserting or updating this property is shown in the following table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput Value for Name\n\n\nValidation Runs?\n\n\nOutcome\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsert value longer than 10 characters\n\n\nYes\n\n\nSuccessful database insert\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsert value shorter than 10 characters\n\n\nYes\n\n\nDatabase insert not executed, exception thrown\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsert value not specified\n\n\nNo\n\n\nDatabase insert fails with non-null violation, exception thrown\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsert value is null\n\n\nNo\n\n\nDatabase insert fails with non-null violation, exception thrown\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate value longer than 10 characters\n\n\nYes\n\n\nSuccessful database update\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate value shorter than 10 characters\n\n\nYes\n\n\nDatabase update not executed, exception thrown\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate value not specified\n\n\nNo\n\n\nSuccessful database update\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate value is explicit null\n\n\nNo\n\n\nSuccessful database update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis behavior allows \nManagedObject\nT\n instances to be partially updated, which also allows for partial PUTs. Partial PUTs can be prevented by adding \nValidate.present()\n metadata to all properties.\n\n\nThis also means that any custom validator can assert that a value passed to \nValidate.validate()\n is non-null.\n\n\nOther Validator Behavior\n\n\nFor validators that can't be built by subclassing \nValidate\n, you may override \nManagedObject\nT\n.validate()\n. This method is useful when a validation involves more than one property. Here's an example:\n\n\nclass\n \nPerson\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_Person\n \nimplements\n \n_Person\n \n{\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nValidationContext\n \nvalidate\n({\nValidating\n \nforEvent:\n \nValidating\n.\ninsert\n})\n \n{\n\n   \nfinal\n \nctx\n \n=\n \nsuper\n.\nvalidate\n(\nforEvent:\n \nforEvent\n);\n\n\n    \nif\n \n(\na\n \n+\n \nb\n \n \n10\n)\n \n{\n\n      \nctx\n.\naddError\n(\na + b must be greater than 10\n);\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nctx\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen overriding this method, the \nsuper\n implementation must be invoked to run validations managed by annotations. You must return the \nValidationContext\n created by the superclass' implementation.\n\n\nSkipping Validations\n\n\nValidations are only run when values are set via \nQuery\nT\n.values\n. Values set via \nQuery\nT\n.valueMap\n are not validated and is useful for inserting data without validation. Here's an example of skipping validation:\n\n\nvar\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nQuery\nPerson\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nvalueMap\n \n=\n \n{\n\n    \nname\n \n:\n \nxyz\n,\n\n    \nemail\n \n:\n \nwhatever\n\n  \n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate and Insert Callbacks\n\n\nManagedObject\nT\n subclasses may override \nwillUpdate\n and \nwillInsert\n to make changes prior to being updated or inserted. For example, a managed object may have updated and created dates that can be guaranteed to be set when inserted or updated:\n\n\nclass\n \nPerson\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_Person\n \nimplements\n \n_Person\n \n{\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nvoid\n \nwillUpdate\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nupdatedAt\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nDateTime\n.\nnow\n().\ntoUtc\n();\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nvoid\n \nwillInsert\n()\n \n{\n\n    \ncreatedAt\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nDateTime\n.\nnow\n().\ntoUtc\n();\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\nclass\n \n_Person\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nprimaryKey\n\n  \nint\n \nid\n;\n\n\n  \nString\n \nname\n;\n\n  \nDateTime\n \ncreatedAt\n;\n\n  \nDateTime\n \nupdatedAt\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth \nwillUpdate\n and \nwillInsert\n are run before any validation occurs. Like validations, \nwillUpdate\n and \nwillInsert\n are skipped when using \nQuery.valueMap\n.",

            "text": "Database Migration and Tooling\n\n\nThe \naqueduct db\n command line tool creates and executes \nmigration files\n. A migration file contains Dart code that executes SQL commands to create and modify database tables. \n\n\n\n\nPostgreSQL 9.6 and Greater\n\n\nThe minimum version of PostgreSQL needed to work with Aqueduct is 9.6.\n\n\n\n\nMigration Files\n\n\nAn application's data model is described by its \nManagedObject\nT\n subclasses and their \ntable definition\n. Migration files describe a series of database commands that will create or modify a database schema to match an application's data model. Migration files are executed on a database when an application is first deployed and when changes to the data model occur - like adding new \nManagedObject\nT\n subclasses or adding an database index to a property.\n\n\nA migration file is automatically generated from your code. Each migration file contains only the changes made since the last migration file was generated. For example, if you began your application with a \nAuthor\n type and generated a migration file, the migration file would create the author table. If you then added a \nBook\n type generated a new migration file, the new file would only create the book table. When a migration is used to upgrade a database schema, every migration file that has not yet been run will be run.\n\n\nMigration files must be stored in version control so that you can manage multiple databases for different environments.\n\n\nGenerating Migration Files\n\n\nThe \naqueduct db generate\n command generates a new migration file. This tool finds all \nManagedObject\nT\n subclasses - your data model - in your application and compares them to the data model the last time the tool was run. Any differences between the data models are represented as a command in the generated migration file. If the new migration file were to be used to upgrade a database, the database would match the current data model in your application.\n\n\n\n\nFinding ManagedObjects\nA managed object subclass must be directly or transitively imported into your application channel file. A file in your project directory that is not imported will not be found. There is typically no need to import a managed object subclass file directly: your application is initialized in your channel, where imports all of your controllers and services, which in turn import the managed object subclasses they use. As long as you are using your managed object declarations in your application, they'll be found.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMigration files are stored in an project's \nmigrations/\n directory. Migration files are prefixed with a version number, a \"0\" padded eight digit number, ad suffixed with \n.migration.dart\n. For example, \n00000001_initial.migration.dart\n is a migration filename. The version number portion of the filename is required, as is the \n.migration.dart\n suffix. The underscore and remainder of the filename are optional and have no effect, they are just a way to name the file. Here is an example of two migration file names:\n\n\n00000001_initial.migration.dart\n00000002_add_user_nickname.migration.dart\n\n\n\n\n\nThe version number of migration files indicate the order in which they are applied. Leading zeros are stripped from the filenames before their version numbers are compared. Version numbers do not necessarily have to be continuous, but doing otherwise is not recommended. Migration files may be created altered after they are generated (see \nseeding data\n).\n\n\nValidating Migration Files\n\n\nThe \naqueduct db validate\n tool validates that the database schema after running all migration files matches the application's data model. The validate tool will display differences found between the schema in code and the schema created by migration files.\n\n\nListing Migration Files\n\n\nUse \naqueduct db list\n to list all database migration files and their resolved version number.\n\n\nGetting a Database's Version\n\n\nYou can fetch a database's current version number with \naqueduct db get-version\n. This command takes \n--connect\n or a \ndatabase.yaml\n file as described in the next section to get connection info for the database.\n\n\nUpgrading a Database Schema by Executing Migration Files\n\n\nThe tool \naqueduct db upgrade\n will apply the commands of migration files to a running database. This tool is run in an application's directory and database connection info is provided with the \n--connect\n option. For example, the following would execute the current project directory's migration files on a PostgreSQL database:\n\n\naqueduct db upgrade --connect postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/my_application\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery migration file that has not yet been run on the targeted database will be run. This tool manages a version table in each database it upgrades that allows it to determine which migration files need to be run.\n\n\nConnection information can alternatively be stored in a database configuration file named \ndatabase.yaml\n in the application directory. If this file exists with the following format, \n--connect\n can be omitted and connection information will be read from this file:\n\n\nusername: \nuser\n\npassword: \npassword\n\nhost: \nhost\n\nport: port\ndatabaseName: \ndatabase\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen to Execute Migration Files\n\n\nDuring development, there is no need to create a migration file for each change. Execute migration files prior to deployment of a new version of an application.\n\n\nYou may delete migration files (as long as you haven't ran them on a production database!). When \naqueduct db generate\n is run again, will replay only the existing migration files before determining which commands to add to the new migration file. For example, if you have 10 migration files over time and delete them all - the next generated migration file will contain commands to recreate the entire database schema.\n\n\nSeeding Data\n\n\nYou may insert, delete, or edit rows during a database migration by overriding its \nseed\n method. You must run SQL queries instead of using \nQuery\nT\n when seeding data. The \nMigration\n base class that all of your migrations extends have a property for a \nPersistentStore\n connected to the database the migration is being run on.\n\n\nclass\n \nMigration2\n \nextends\n \nMigration\n \n{\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nFuture\n \nupgrade\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \n...\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nFuture\n \ndowngrade\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \n...\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nFuture\n \nseed\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nawait\n \nstore\n.\nexecuteQuery\n(\nINSERT IN _mytable (a) VALUES (1)\n);\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeeding is ran after a migration's \nugprade\n method has completed. Seeding data also occurs in the same transaction as \nupgrade\n.\n\n\nHandling Non-nullable Additions\n\n\nSome database upgrades can fail depending on the data currently in the database. A common scenario is adding a property to an existing managed object that is not-nullable. If the database table already has rows, those rows would not have a value for the new column and the migration would fail. If the database does not have any rows, the migration will succeed correctly. If the property has a default value attribute or is auto-incrementing, the migration will always succeed and the existing rows will have the default value for the new column.\n\n\nYou may also provide a value just for the existing rows to make the migration succeed. This is added as an argument to the schema-altering command that would violate non-nullability:\n\n\n@\noverride\n\n\nFuture\n \nupgrade\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n  \ndatabase\n.\naddColumn\n(\n_mytable\n,\n \nSchemaColumn\n(...),\n \nunencodedInitialValue:\n \ntext\n)\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unencoded initial value is inserted directly into a SQL command. This requires that the value be a SQL value literal as shown in the table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\n\n\nUnencoded Initial Value\n\n\nValue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nint\n\n\n\"1\"\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nString\n\n\n\"'string'\"\n\n\n'string'\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndouble\n\n\n\"2.0\"\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDateTime\n\n\n\"'1900-01-02T00:00:00.000Z'\"\n\n\n1/2/1900",

This is likely a \nMap\n or \nList\n, but can be any JSON-encodable object. Because the data stored in a \nDocument\n property is unstructured, the type of \ndata\n is \ndynamic\n. It is good practice to store consistent data structures in a column; i.e., always storing a \nMap\n or always storing a \nList\n.\n\n\nUpdating Rows with Document Properties\n\n\nUpdating a row with \nDocument\n properties works the same as inserting rows.\n\n\nfinal\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nEvent\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nwhere\n((\ne\n)\n \n=\n \ne\n.\nid\n).\nequalTo\n(\n1\n)\n\n  \n..\nvalues\n.\ncontents\n \n=\n \nDocument\n({\n\n    \ntype\n:\n \npush\n,\n\n    \nuser\n:\n \nbob\n,\n\n    \ntags\n:\n \n[\nv1\n,\n \nnew\n]\n\n  \n});\n\n\nfinal\n \nevent\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nquery\n.\nupdateOne\n();\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen updating in this way, the document stored in the column is replaced entirely.\n\n\nAccessing Document Values\n\n\nThe type of \nDocument.data\n is \ndynamic\n - it can be any valid JSON type and may be casted to the expected type when used. This data can also be nested - a \nList\n of \nMaps\n, for example. When accessing object keys or list indices, you may use the subscript operator directly on \nDocument\n.\n\n\n// Object Access by key\n\n\nfinal\n \ndoc\n \n=\n \nDocument\n({\nkey\n:\n \nvalue\n});\n\n\nfinal\n \nvalue\n \n=\n \ndoc\n[\nkey\n]\n \n==\n \nvalue\n;\n\n\n\n// List Access by index\n\n\nfinal\n \ndoc\n \n=\n \nDocument\n([\nv1\n,\n \nv2\n]);\n\n\nfinal\n \nvalue\n \n=\n \ndoc\n[\n0\n]\n \n==\n \nv1\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can access nested elements with the same syntax:\n\n\nfinal\n \ndoc\n \n=\n \nDocument\n([\n\n  \n{\nid\n:\n \n1\n},\n\n  \n{\nid\n:\n \n2\n}\n\n\n]);\n\n\n\nfinal\n \nobj1\n \n=\n \ndoc\n[\n0\n][\nid\n];\n \n// == 1\n\n\nfinal\n \nobj2\n \n=\n \ndoc\n[\n1\n][\nid\n];\n \n// == 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that using the subscript operator on a \nDocument\n simply invokes it on its \ndata\n property. Therefore, any subscript values must be valid for Dart \nList\n and \nMap\n types.\n\n\nFetching Sub-documents\n\n\nWhen fetching a \nDocument\n property, the default behavior is to return the entire JSON document as it is stored in the database column.

For example, if the above query were executed and the stored column's value were:\n\n\n{\n\n  \ntype\n:\n \npush\n,\n  \n  \nuser\n:\n \nbob\n,\n\n  \ntags\n:\n \n[\nv1\n]\n  \n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe value of \nEvent.contents\n would only contain the array for the key \"tags\":\n\n\n[\nv1\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also index arrays in a JSON column using the same subscript operator, and the subscript operator can also be nested. For example, the following query would fetch the \"tags\" array, and then fetch the string at index 0 from it:\n\n\nfinal\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nEvent\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nreturningProperties\n((\ne\n)\n \n=\n \n[\ne\n.\nid\n,\n \ne\n.\ncontents\n[\ntags\n][\n0\n]]);\n\n\nfinal\n \neventsWithFirstTag\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nquery\n.\nfetchOne\n();\n\n\neventsWithFirstTag\n.\ncontents\n.\ndata\n \n==\n \nv1\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a key or index does not exist in the JSON document, the value of the returned property will be null. For this reason, you should use null-aware operators when accessing \nDocument.data\n:\n\n\nfinal\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nEvent\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nreturningProperties\n((\ne\n)\n \n=\n \n[\ne\n.\nid\n,\n \ne\n.\ncontents\n[\ntags\n][\n7\n]]);\n \n// 7 is out of bounds\n\n\nfinal\n \neventsWithFirstTag\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nquery\n.\nfetchOne\n();\n\n\nif\n \n(\neventsWithFirstTag\n.\ncontents\n?\n.\ndata\n \n==\n \nv1\n)\n \n{\n\n  \n...\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen fetching elements from a JSON array, you may use negative indices to specify a index from the end of the array.\n\n\nfinal\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nEvent\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n  \n..\nreturningProperties\n((\ne\n)\n \n=\n \n[\ne\n.\nid\n,\n \ne\n.\ncontents\n[\ntags\n][\n-\n1\n]]);\n\n\nfinal\n \neventsWithLastTag\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nquery\n.\nfetchOne\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that you can only fetch a single sub-structure from a \nDocument\n column per query.

Storage is accomplished by Aqueduct's ORM. \nManagedAuthDelegate\nT\n, by default, is not part of the standard \naqueduct\n library. To use this class, an application must import \npackage:aqueduct/managed_auth.dart\n.\n\n\nThe type argument to \nManagedAuthDelegate\nT\n represents the application's concept of a 'user' or 'account' - OAuth 2.0 terminology would refer to this type as a \nresource owner\n. A resource owner must be a \nManagedObject\nT\n subclass that is specific to your application. Its table definition \nmust extend\n \nResourceOwnerTableDefinition\n and the instance type must implement \nManagedAuthResourceOwner\nT\n, where \nT\n is the table definition. A basic definition may look like this:\n\n\nclass\n \nUser\n \nextends\n \nManagedObject\n_User\n\n    \nimplements\n \n_User\n,\n \nManagedAuthResourceOwner\n_User\n \n{\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nclass\n \n_User\n \nextends\n \nResourceOwnerTableDefinition\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nColumn\n(\nunique:\n \ntrue\n)\n\n  \nString\n \nemail\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy extending \nResourceOwnerTableDefinition\n in the table definition, the database table has the following four columns:\n\n\n\n\nan integer primary key named \nid\n\n\na unique string \nusername\n\n\na password hash\n\n\na salt used to generate the password hash\n\n\n\n\nA \nResourceOwnerTableDefinition\n also has a \nManagedSet\n of \ntokens\n for each token that has been granted on its behalf.\n\n\nThe interface \nManagedAuthResourceOwner\nT\n is a requirement that ensures the type argument is both a \nManagedObject\nT\n and \nResourceOwnerTableDefinition\n, and serves no other purpose than to restrict \nManagedAuthDelegate\nT\n's type parameter.\n\n\nThis structure allows an application to declare its own 'user' type while still enforcing the needs of Aqueduct's OAuth 2.0 implementation.\n\n\nThe \nmanaged_auth\n library also declares two \nManagedObject\nT\n subclasses. \nManagedAuthToken\n represents instances of authorization tokens and codes, and \nManagedAuthClient\n represents instances of OAuth 2.0 clients. This means that an Aqueduct application that uses \nManagedAuthDelegate\nT\n has a minimum of three database tables: users, tokens and clients.\n\n\nManagedAuthDelegate\nT\n will delete authorization tokens and codes when they are no longer in use. This is determined by how many tokens a resource owner has and the tokens expiration dates. Once a resource owner acquires more than 40 tokens/codes, the oldest tokens/codes (determined by expiration date) are deleted. Effectively, the resource owner is limited to 40 tokens. This number can be changed when instantiating \nManagedAuthDelegate\nT\n:\n\n\nfinal\n \ndelegate\n \n=\n \nManagedAuthDelegate\n(\ncontext\n,\n \ntokenLimit:\n \n20\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the Database\n\n\nManagedAuthDelegate\nT\n requires database tables for its users, tokens and clients. Use the \ndatabase command-line tool\n on your project to generate migration scripts and execute them against a database. This tool will see the declarations for your user type, \nManagedAuthToken\n and \nManagedAuthClient\n and create the appropriate tables.",

Here's an example of creating an  AuthServer  and  ManagedAuthDelegate T :  import   package:aqueduct/aqueduct.dart ;  import   package:aqueduct/managed_auth.dart ;  class   MyApplicationChannel   extends   ApplicationChannel   {   \n   AuthServer   authServer ; \n\n   @ override \n   Future   prepare ()   async   { \n     final   context   =   ManagedContext (...); \n     final   delegate   =   ManagedAuthDelegate User ( context ); \n     authServer   =   AuthServer ( delegate ); \n   } \n\n   ...  }   (Notice that  ManagedAuthDelegate  has a type argument - this will be covered in the next section.)  While  AuthServer  has methods for handling authorization tasks, it is rarely used directly. Instead,  AuthCodeController  and  AuthController  are hooked up to routes to grant authorization tokens through your application's HTTP API. Instances of  Authorizer  secure routes in channels. All of these types invoke the appropriate methods on the  AuthServer . Here's an example  ApplicationChannel  subclass that sets up and uses authorization:  import   package:aqueduct/aqueduct.dart ;  import   package:aqueduct/managed_auth.dart ;  class   MyApplicationChannel   extends   ApplicationChannel   { \n   AuthServer   authServer ; \n   ManagedContext   context ; \n\n   @ override \n   Future   prepare ()   async   { \n     context   =   ManagedContext (...); \n     final   delegate   =   ManagedAuthDelegate User ( context ); \n     authServer   =   AuthServer ( delegate ); \n   } \n\n   @ override \n   Controller   get   entryPoint   { \n     final   router   =   Router (); \n\n     // Set up auth token route- this grants and refresh tokens \n     router . route ( /auth/token ). link (()   =   AuthController ( authServer )); \n\n     // Set up auth code route- this grants temporary access codes that can be exchanged for token \n     router . route ( /auth/code ). link (()   =   AuthCodeController ( authServer )); \n\n     // Set up protected route \n     router \n       . route ( /protected ) \n       . link (()   =   Authorizer . bearer ( authServer )) \n       . link (()   =   ProtectedController ()); \n\n     return   router ; \n   }  }   For more details on authorization controllers like  AuthController , see  Authorization Controllers .

            "text": "ManagedAuthDelegate T  is a concrete implementation of  AuthServerDelegate , providing storage of authorization tokens and clients for an  AuthServer . Storage is accomplished by Aqueduct's ORM.  ManagedAuthDelegate T , by default, is not part of the standard  aqueduct  library. To use this class, an application must import  package:aqueduct/managed_auth.dart .  The type argument to  ManagedAuthDelegate T  represents the application's concept of a 'user' or 'account' - OAuth 2.0 terminology would refer to this type as a  resource owner . A resource owner must be a  ManagedObject T  subclass that is specific to your application. Its table definition  must extend   ResourceOwnerTableDefinition  and the instance type must implement  ManagedAuthResourceOwner T , where  T  is the table definition. A basic definition may look like this:  class   User   extends   ManagedObject _User \n     implements   _User ,   ManagedAuthResourceOwner _User   {  }  class   _User   extends   ResourceOwnerTableDefinition   { \n   @ Column ( unique:   true ) \n   String   email ;  }   By extending  ResourceOwnerTableDefinition  in the table definition, the database table has the following four columns:   an integer primary key named  id  a unique string  username  a password hash  a salt used to generate the password hash   A  ResourceOwnerTableDefinition  also has a  ManagedSet  of  tokens  for each token that has been granted on its behalf.  The interface  ManagedAuthResourceOwner T  is a requirement that ensures the type argument is both a  ManagedObject T  and  ResourceOwnerTableDefinition , and serves no other purpose than to restrict  ManagedAuthDelegate T 's type parameter.  This structure allows an application to declare its own 'user' type while still enforcing the needs of Aqueduct's OAuth 2.0 implementation.  The  managed_auth  library also declares two  ManagedObject T  subclasses.  ManagedAuthToken  represents instances of authorization tokens and codes, and  ManagedAuthClient  represents instances of OAuth 2.0 clients. This means that an Aqueduct application that uses  ManagedAuthDelegate T  has a minimum of three database tables: users, tokens and clients.  ManagedAuthDelegate T  will delete authorization tokens and codes when they are no longer in use. This is determined by how many tokens a resource owner has and the tokens expiration dates. Once a resource owner acquires more than 40 tokens/codes, the oldest tokens/codes (determined by expiration date) are deleted. Effectively, the resource owner is limited to 40 tokens. This number can be changed when instantiating  ManagedAuthDelegate T :  final   delegate   =   ManagedAuthDelegate ( context ,   tokenLimit:   20 );",

The named constructors of \nAuthorizer\n indicate the required format of Authorization header. The \nAuthorization.bearer()\n constructor expects an OAuth 2.0 bearer token in the header, which has the following format:\n\n\nAuthorization\n:\n \nBearer\n \n768\niuzjkx82jkasjkd9z9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorizer.basic\n expects HTTP Basic Authentication, where the username and password are joined with the colon character (\n:\n) and Base 64-encoded:\n\n\n// \ndXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA==\n is \nuser:password\n\nAuthorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA==\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the header can't be parsed, doesn't exist or is in the wrong format, an \nAuthorizer\n responds to the request with a 401 status code and prevents the next controller from receiving the request.\n\n\nOnce parsed, an \nAuthorizer\n sends the information - either the bearer token, or the username and password - to its \nAuthServer\n for verification. If the \nAuthServer\n rejects the authorization info, the \nAuthorizer\n responds to the request with a 401 status code and prevents the next controller from receiving the request. Otherwise, the request continues to the next controller.\n\n\nFor \nAuthorizer.bearer\n, the value in a request's header must be a valid, unexpired access token. These types of authorizers are used when an endpoint requires a logged in user.\n\n\nFor \nAuthorizer.basic\n authorizers, credentials are verified by finding an OAuth 2.0 client identifier and ensuring its client secret matches. Routes with this type of authorizer are known as \nclient authenticated\n routes. These types of authorizers are used when an endpoint requires a valid client application, but not a logged in user.\n\n\nAuthorizer and OAuth 2.0 Scope\n\n\nAn \nAuthorizer\n may restrict access to controllers based on the scope of the request's bearer token. By default, an \nAuthorizer.bearer\n allows any valid bearer token to pass through it. If desired, an \nAuthorizer\n is initialized with a list of required scopes. A request may only pass the \nAuthorizer\n if it has access to \nall\n scopes listed in the \nAuthorizer\n. For example, the following requires at least \nuser:posts\n and \nlocation\n scope:\n\n\nrouter\n\n  \n.\nroute\n(\n/checkin\n)\n\n  \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nAuthorizer\n.\nbearer\n(\nauthServer\n,\n \nscopes:\n \n[\nuser:posts\n,\n \nlocation\n]))\n\n  \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nCheckInController\n());\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that you don't have to use an \nAuthorizer\n to restrict access based on scope. A controller has access to scope information after the request has passed through an \nAuthorizer\n, so it can use the scope to make more granular authorization decisions.\n\n\nAuthorization Objects\n\n\nA bearer token represents a granted authorization - at some point in the past, a user provided their credentials and the token is the proof of that. When a bearer token is sent in the authorization header of an HTTP request, the application can look up which user the token is for and the client application it was issued for. This information is stored in an instance of \nAuthorization\n after the token has been verified and is assigned to \nRequest.authorization\n.\n\n\nControllers protected by an \nAuthorizer\n can access this information to further determine their behavior. For example, a social networking application might have a \n/news_feed\n endpoint protected by an \nAuthorizer\n. When an authenticated user makes a request for \n/news_feed\n, the controller will return that user's news feed. It can determine this by using the \nAuthorization\n:\n\n\nclass\n \nNewsFeedController\n \nextends\n \nResourceController\n \n{\n\n  \nNewsFeedController\n(\nthis\n.\ncontext\n);\n\n\n  \nManagedContext\n \ncontext\n;\n\n\n  \n@\nOperation\n.\nget\n()\n\n  \nFuture\nResponse\n \ngetNewsFeed\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nvar\n \nforUserID\n \n=\n \nrequest\n.\nauthorization\n.\nownerID\n;\n\n\n    \nvar\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nPost\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n      \n..\nwhere\n((\np\n)\n \n=\n \np\n.\nauthor\n).\nidentifiedBy\n(\nforUserID\n);\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\nawait\n \nquery\n.\nfetch\n());\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above controller, it's impossible for a user to access another user's posts.\n\n\nAuthorization\n objects also retain the scope of an access token so that a controller can make more granular decisions about the information/action in the endpoint. Checking whether an \nAuthorization\n has access to a particular scope is accomplished by either looking at the list of its \nscopes\n or using \nauthorizedForScope\n:\n\n\nclass\n \nNewsFeedController\n \nextends\n \nResourceController\n \n{\n\n  \nNewsFeedController\n(\nthis\n.\ncontext\n);\n\n\n  \nManagedContext\n \ncontext\n;\n\n\n  \n@\nOperation\n.\nget\n()\n\n  \nFuture\nResponse\n \ngetNewsFeed\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nif\n \n(\n!\nrequest\n.\nauthorization\n.\nauthorizedForScope\n(\nuser:feed\n))\n \n{\n\n      \nreturn\n \nResponse\n.\nunauthorized\n();\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nvar\n \nforUserID\n \n=\n \nrequest\n.\nauthorization\n.\nownerID\n;\n\n\n    \nvar\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nQuery\nPost\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n      \n..\nwhere\n((\np\n)\n \n=\n \np\n.\nauthor\n).\nidentifiedBy\n(\nforUserID\n);\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\nawait\n \nquery\n.\nfetch\n());\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Authorizers Without AuthServer\n\n\nThroughout this guide, the argument to an instance of \nAuthorizer\n has been referred to as an \nAuthServer\n.

The Authorization header is parsed and verified by \nAuthController\n.\n\n\nOnce granted, an access token can be used to pass \nAuthorizer.bearer()\ns in the application channel.\n\n\nIssue Authorization Codes with AuthCodeController\n\n\nAn \nAuthCodeController\n manages the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow. The authorization code flow is used when an Aqueduct application allows third party applications access to authorized resources.\n\n\nLet's say you've built an Aqueduct application that allows people to store notes for themselves. Now, a friend approaches you with their application that is a to-do list. Instead of building their own note-taking feature, your friend wants users of their application to access the notes the user has stored in your application. While trustworthy, you don't want your friend to have access to the username and passwords of your subscribers.\n\n\nYour friend adds a link to their application that takes the user to an HTML page hosted by your server. The user enters their credentials in this page, which sends a \nPOST\n request to your server. Your server responds by redirecting the user's browser back into your friend's application. An \nauthorization code\n is included in the query string of the redirect URL.\n\n\nYour friend's application parses the code from the URL and sends it to \ntheir\n server. Behind the scenes, their server exchanges this code with your server for an access token.\n\n\nAn \nAuthCodeController\n responds to both \nGET\n and \nPOST\n requests. When issued a \nGET\n, it serves up a HTML page with a login form. This login form's submit action sends a \nPOST\n to the same endpoint with the username and password of the user. Upon success, the response from the \nPOST\n is a 302 redirect with an authorization code.\n\n\nSetting up an \nAuthCodeController\n is nearly as simple as setting up an \nAuthController\n, but requires a function that renders the HTML login form. Here's an example:\n\n\n@\noverride\n\n\nController\n \nget\n \nentryPoint\n \n{\n\n  \nfinal\n \nrouter\n \n=\n \nRouter\n();\n\n\n  \nrouter\n\n    \n.\nroute\n(\n/auth/code\n)\n\n    \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nAuthCodeController\n(\n\n      \nauthServer\n,\n \nrenderAuthorizationPageHTML:\n \nrenderLogin\n));\n\n\n  \nreturn\n \nrouter\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nFuture\nString\n \nrenderLogin\n(\n\n    \nAuthCodeController\n \nrequestingController\n,\n\n    \nURI\n \nrequestURI\n,\n\n    \nMap\nString\n,\n \nString\n \nqueryParameters\n)\n \n{\n\n  \nvar\n \nhtml\n \n=\n \nHTMLRenderer\n.\ntemplateWithSubstitutions\n(\n\n    \nweb/login.html\n,\n \nrequestURI\n,\n \nqueryParameters\n);\n\n\n  \nreturn\n \nhtml\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important that all values passed to HTML rendering function are sent in the form's query parameters - they contain necessary security components and scope information.\n\n\nWhen your friend's application links to your login page - \nGET /auth/code\n - they must include three query parameters: \nstate\n, \nclient_id\n, \nresponse_type\n. They may optionally include \nscope\n.\n\n\nhttps://stablekernel.com/auth/code?client_id=friend.app\nresponse_type=code\nstate=87uijn3rkja\n\n\n\n\n\nThe value of \nclient_id\n must be created specifically for your friend's application and stored in your database. (See more on generating client identifiers with \naqueduct auth\n in \nAqueduct Auth CLI\n.) The \nresponse_type\n must always be \ncode\n. The \nstate\n must be a value your friend's application creates - it is often some random value like a session cookie.\n\n\nWhen a user of your friend's application goes through this process, they are redirected back into your friend's application. Both the generated authorization code and the value for \nstate\n will be query parameters in the URL. That redirect URL will look like:\n\n\nhttps://friends.app/code_callback?code=abcd672kk\nstate=87uijn3rkja\n\n\n\n\n\nThe redirect URL is pre-determined when generating the client identifier with \naqueduct auth\n.\n\n\nYour friend's application verifies that \nstate\n matches the \nstate\n they sent in \nGET /auth/code\n. They then send the \ncode\n to their server. The server then exchanges this code with your server by issuing a \nPOST\n to an \nAuthController\n - \nNOT\n the \nAuthCodeController\n - with the following \napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded\n body:\n\n\ngrant_type=authorization_code\ncode=abcd672kk\n\n\n\n\n\nAn access token will be returned to the server which your friend then stores in their database. Whenever one of their users makes a request that requires accessing your application's data, they will execute requests with that access token.",

For example, a user may need special permission to create 'notes', but every user can read notes. In OAuth 2.0, permissions for operations are determined by an access token's \nscope\n. Operations can be defined to require certain scopes, and a request may only invoke those operations if its access token was granted with those scopes.\n\n\nA scope is a string identifier, like \nnotes\n or \nnotes.readonly\n. When a client application authenticates on behalf of a user, it requests one or more of these scope identifiers to be granted to the access token. Valid scopes will be stored with the access token, so that the scope can be referenced by subsequent uses of the access token.\n\n\nScope Usage in Aqueduct\n\n\nAn access token's scope is determined when a user authenticates. During authentication, a client application indicates the requested scope, and the Aqueduct application determines if that scope is permissible for the client application and the user. This scope information is attached to the access token.\n\n\nWhen a request is made with an access token, an \nAuthorizer\n retrieves the token's scope. After the request is validated, the \nAuthorizer\n stores scope information in \nRequest.authorization\n. Linked controllers can use this information to determine how the request is handled. In general, a controller will reject a request and send a 403 Forbidden response when an access token has insufficient scope for an operation.\n\n\nTherefore, adding scopes to an application consists of three steps:\n\n\n\n\nAdding scope restrictions to operations.\n\n\nAdding permissible scopes for OAuth2 client identifiers (and optionally users).\n\n\nUpdating client applications to request scope when authenticating.\n\n\n\n\nAdding Scope Restrictions to Operations\n\n\nWhen an \nAuthorizer\n handles a request, it creates an \nAuthorization\n object that is attached to the request. An \nAuthorization\n object has a \nscopes\n property that contains every scope granted for the access token. This object also has a convenience method for checking if a particular scope is valid for that list of scopes:\n\n\nclass\n \nNoteController\n \nextends\n \nController\n \n{\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nFuture\nRequestOrResponse\n \nhandle\n(\nRequest\n \nrequest\n)\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nif\n \n(\n!\nrequest\n.\nauthorization\n.\nisAuthorizedForScope\n(\nnotes\n))\n \n{\n\n      \nreturn\n \nResponse\n.\nforbidden\n();\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n(\nawait\n \ngetAllNotes\n());\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse an Authorizer\n\n\nThe \nauthorization\n property of \nRequest\n is only valid after the request is handled by an \nAuthorizer\n. It is \nnull\n otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nAn \nAuthorizer\n may also validate the scope of a request before letting it pass to its linked controller.\n\n\nrouter\n\n  \n.\nroute\n(\n/notes\n)\n\n  \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nAuthorizer\n.\nbearer\n(\nauthServer\n,\n \nscopes:\n \n[\nnotes\n]))\n\n  \n.\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nNoteController\n());\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above, the \nNoteController\n will only be reached if the request's bearer token has 'notes' scope.

This applies to all operations of the \nNoteController\n.\n\n\nIt often makes sense to have separate scope for different operations on the same resource. The \nScope\n annotation may be added to \nResourceController\n operation methods for this purpose.\n\n\nclass\n \nNoteController\n \nextends\n \nResourceController\n \n{\n\n  \n@\nScope\n([\nnotes.readonly\n])\n\n  \n@\nOperation\n.\nget\n()\n\n  \nFuture\nResponse\n \ngetNotes\n()\n \nasync\n \n=\n \n...;\n\n\n  \n@\nScope\n([\nnotes\n])\n\n  \n@\nOperation\n.\npost\n()\n\n  \nFuture\nResponse\n \ncreateNote\n(\n@\nBind\n.\nbody\n()\n \nNote\n \nnote\n)\n \nasync\n \n=\n \n...;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a request does not have sufficient scope for the intended operation method, a 403 Forbidden response is sent. When using \nScope\n annotations, you must link an \nAuthorizer\n prior to the \nResourceController\n, but it is not necessary to specify \nAuthorizer\n scopes.  \n\n\nIf a \nScope\n annotation or \nAuthorizer\n contains multiple scope entries, an access token must have scope for each of those entries. For example, the annotation \n@Scope(['notes', 'user'])\n requires an access token to have both 'notes' and 'user' scope.\n\n\nDefining Permissible Scope\n\n\nWhen a client application authenticates on behalf of a user, it includes a list of request scopes for the access token. An Aqueduct application will grant the requested scopes to the  token if the scopes are permissible for both the authenticating client identifier and the authenticating user.\n\n\nTo add permissible scopes to an authenticating client, you use the \naqueduct auth\n command-line tool. When creating a new client identifier, include the \n--allowed-scopes\n options:\n\n\naqueduct auth add-client \n\\\n\n  --id com.app.mobile \n\\\n\n  --secret myspecialsecret \n\\\n\n  --allowed-scopes \nnotes users\n \n\\\n\n  --connect postgres://user:password@dbhost:5432/db_name\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen modifying an existing client identifier, use the command \naqueduct auth set-scope\n:\n\n\naqueduct auth set-scope \n\\\n\n  --id com.app.mobile \n\\\n\n  --scopes \nnotes users\n \n\\\n\n  --connect postgres://user:password@dbhost:5432/db_name\n\n\n\n\n\nEach scope is a space-delimited string; the above examples allow clients authenticating with the \ncom.app.mobile\n client ID to grant access tokens with 'notes' and 'users' scope. If a client application requests scopes that are not available for that client application, the granted access token will not contain that scope. If none of the request scopes are available for the client identifier, no access token is granted. When adding scope restrictions to your application, you must ensure that all of the client applications that have access to those operations are able to grant that scope.\n\n\nScopes may also be limited by some attribute of your application's concept of a 'user'. This user-level filtering is done by overriding \ngetAllowedScopes\n in \nAuthServerDelegate\n. By default, this method returns \nAuthScope.Any\n - which means there are no restrictions. If the client application allows the scope, then any user that logs in with that application can request that scope.\n\n\nThis method may return a list of \nAuthScope\ns that are valid for the authenticating user. The following example shows a \nManagedAuthDelegate\nT\n subclass that allows any scope for \n@stablekernel.com\n usernames, no scopes for \n@hotmail.com\n addresses and some limited scope for everyone else:\n\n\nclass\n \nDomainBasedAuthDelegate\n \nextends\n \nManagedAuthDelegate\nUser\n \n{\n\n  \nDomainBasedAuthDelegate\n(\nManagedContext\n \ncontext\n,\n \n{\nint\n \ntokenLimit:\n \n40\n})\n \n:\n\n        \nsuper\n(\ncontext\n,\n \ntokenLimit:\n \ntokenLimit\n);\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nList\nAuthScope\n \ngetAllowedScopes\n(\ncovariant\n \nUser\n \nuser\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nif\n \n(\nuser\n.\nusername\n.\nendsWith\n(\n@stablekernel.com\n))\n \n{\n\n      \nreturn\n \nAuthScope\n.\nAny\n;\n\n    \n}\n \nelse\n \nif\n \n(\nuser\n.\nusername\n.\nendsWith\n(\n@hotmail.com\n))\n \n{\n\n      \nreturn\n \n[];\n\n    \n}\n \nelse\n \n{\n\n      \nreturn\n \n[\nAuthScope\n(\nuser\n)];\n\n    \n}\n\n  \n}\n      \n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nuser\n passed to \ngetAllowedScopes\n is the user being authenticated.

The default implementation of this method for \nManagedAuthDelegate\nT\n only fetches the \nid\n, \nusername\n, \nsalt\n and \nhashedPassword\n of the user.\n\n\nWhen using some other attribute of an application's user object to restrict allowed scopes, you must also override \ngetResourceOwner\n to fetch these attributes.

When authenticating through \nAuthController\n, a \nscope\n parameter must be added to the form data body. This parameter's value must be a space-delimited, URL-encoded list of requested scopes.\n\n\nusername=bob\npassword=foo\ngrant_type=password\nscope=notes%20users\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen authenticating via an \nAuthCodeController\n, this same query parameter is added to the initial \nGET\n request to render the login form.\n\n\nWhen authentication is complete, the list of granted scopes will be available in the JSON response body as a space-delimited string.\n\n\n{\n\n  \naccess_token\n:\n \n...\n,\n\n  \nrefresh_token\n:\n \n...\n,\n\n  \ntoken_type\n:\n \nbearer\n,\n\n  \nexpires_in\n:\n \n3600\n,\n\n  \nscopes\n:\n \nnotes users\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScope Format and Hierarchy\n\n\nThere is no definitive guide on what a scope string should look like, other than being restricted to alphanumeric characters and some symbols. Aqueduct, however, provides a simple scoping structure - there are two special symbols, \n:\n and \n.\n.\n\n\nHierarchy is specified by the \n:\n character. For example, the following is a hierarchy of scopes related to a user and its sub-resources:\n\n\n\n\nuser\n (can read/write everything a user has)\n\n\nuser:email\n (can read/write a user's email)\n\n\nuser:documents\n (can read/write a user's documents)\n\n\nuser:documents:spreadsheets\n (can read/write a user's spreadsheet documents)\n\n\n\n\nNotice how these scopes form a hierarchy. Each segment makes the scope more restrictive. For example, if an access token has \nuser:email\n scope, it only allows access to a user's email. However, if the access token has \nuser\n scope, it allows access to everything a user has, including their email.\n\n\nAs another example, an access token with \nuser:documents\n scope can access all of a user's documents, but the scope \nuser:documents:spreadsheets\n is limited to only spreadsheet documents.\n\n\nScope is often used to indicate read vs. write access. At first glance, it might sound like a good idea to use the hierarchy operator, e.g. \nuser:email:read\n and \nuser:email:write\n. However, an access token with \nuser:email:write\n \ndoes not\n have permission to read email and this is likely unintended.\n\n\nThis is where \nscope modifiers\n come in. A scope modifier is added after a \n.\n at the end of a scope string. For example, \nuser:email.readonly\n grants readonly access to a user's email whereas \nuser:email\n grants read and write access.\n\n\nAn access token without a modifier has permission \nany\n modifier. Thus, \nuser\n and \nuser:email\n can both access \nuser:email.readonly\n protected resources and actions, but \nuser:email.readonly\n cannot access resources protected by \nuser:email\n.\n\n\nA scope modifier is only valid for the last segment of a scope string. That is, \nuser:documents.readonly:spreadsheets\n is not valid, but \nuser:documents:spreadsheets.readonly\n is.",

            "location": "/auth/what_is_oauth/", 
            "text": "What is OAuth 2.0?\n\n\nMost applications have the concept of a user. To prevent just anyone from saying they are this user, the user has a password. When a user wants to use your application, they send their username and password to the server so it can ensure they are who they say they are.\n\n\nThe simple way to do this is to send the username and password in an Authorization header for every request. Two reasons this is bad: first, every time the user wants to do something, their password is sent in every request and that can be unsafe. Second, any application that wants to keep the user logged in has to store that password - and that is unsafe.\n\n\nIn OAuth 2.0, the user gives their username and password to a client application once. The application sends those credentials to a server, and the server gives the application back an access token. A access token is a long, random string that no one can guess. When the user wants to do more stuff, the application sends the token with every request, instead of the user's password. The server checks the token, makes sure its not expired, and then lets the application's request go through. The application doesn't have to store the password and doesn't have to ask the user for their password again.\n\n\nThis credential-for-token exchange happens by sending a POST request to some endpoint, where the username and password are sent in the request body. Typically, an Aqueduct application's route for this is \n/auth/token\n and handled by an instance of \nAuthController\n.\n\n\nOAuth 2.0 makes a subtle distinction: a user and the application they are using are not the same thing. It's intuitive to think of a user as \"making a request to the server\", but in reality, the user makes a request to an application and \nthe application\n makes the request to the server. The server \ngrants\n the application access on behalf of the user. In other words, when a user enters their credentials into an application, the application goes to the server and says \"Hey, this user said I can do stuff for them. Look, this is their secret password!\"\n\n\nThis is an important distinction, because an OAuth 2.0 server doesn't just verify users: it also verifies applications. An application has a identifier that has been registered with the server. So, for an ecosystem that has a web client, an Android and an iOS app there would likely be three identifiers - one for each. The client application usually stores that identifier in a database. This identifier is called a \nclient identifier\n. Client identifiers are added to Aqueduct applications with the \naqueduct auth\n tool (see \nAqueduct Auth CLI\n).\n\n\nWhen the user is logging in through an application, they submit their username and password. The user doesn't provide the client identifier - in fact, the user doesn't know it. The application sends a request with the user's username and password in the request body, and the client identifier in the Authorization header. All three have to check out for the server to give the application back a token. The full request in pseudo-code looks something like:\n\n\nvar\n \nrequest\n \n=\n \nHTTPRequest\n(\n/auth/token\n);\n\n\nrequest\n.\nmethod\n \n=\n \nPOST\n;\n\n\nrequest\n.\ncontentType\n \n=\n \napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded\n;\n\n\nrequest\n.\nauthorization\n \n=\n \nBase64\n.\nencode\n(\n$\nclientID\n:\n);\n\n\nrequest\n.\nbody\n \n=\n \n{\n\n  \nusername\n \n:\n \nbob@stablekernel.com\n,\n\n  \npassword\n \n:\n \nsupersecretstuff\n,\n\n  \ngrant_type\n \n:\n \npassword\n\n\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn access token can expire. How long it takes to expire is up to the server - Aqueduct defaults to 24 hours. At first glance, this means that the application would have to ask the user for a password again. But, tokens can also be refreshed. Refreshing a token grants a brand new access token, but without having to ask for the password. This is possible because an access token comes with a \nrefresh token\n. The refresh token is another long, random string. So, the JSON the server sends back when granting a token looks like this:\n\n\n{\n\n  \naccess_token\n \n:\n \nAbca09zzzza2o2kelmzlli3ijlka\n,\n\n  \ntoken_type\n \n:\n \nbearer\n,\n\n  \nrefresh_token\n \n:\n \nlkmLIAmooa898nm20jannnnnxaww\n,\n\n  \nexpire_in\n \n:\n \n3600\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe application hangs on to both an access token and a refresh token. When the token expires, it will send the refresh token back to the server to get a replacement access token. This is done through the same route that the access token came from - \n/auth/token\n - except the parameters are a bit different:\n\n\nvar\n \nrequest\n \n=\n \nHTTPRequest\n(\n/auth/token\n);\n\n\nrequest\n.\nmethod\n \n=\n \nPOST\n;\n\n\nrequest\n.\ncontentType\n \n=\n \napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded\n;\n\n\nrequest\n.\nauthorization\n \n=\n \nBase64\n.\nencode\n(\n$\nclientID\n:\n);\n\n\nrequest\n.\nbody\n \n=\n \n{\n\n  \nrefresh_token\n \n:\n \nlkmLIAmooa898nm20jannnnnxaww\n,\n\n  \ngrant_type\n \n:\n \nrefresh_token\n\n\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExchanging a refresh token has the same response as the initial exchange for username and password - except a few values will have changed.\n\n\nThe verification and storage of authorization and authentication information is managed by an \nAuthServer\n.\n\n\nOther Methods for Obtaining Authorization\n\n\nThe method of getting a token above - sending a username and password to \n/auth/token\n - is just one of four possible methods OAuth 2.0 uses to authenticate a user. This particular one is called the \nresource owner password credentials grant\n. A resource owner is a fancy word for a 'user'. We can shorten it up to just the 'password flow'. It's probably the most common flow - mobiles applications and front-end web applications often use this flow. When you enter your credentials, the client application sends them directly to the server.\n\n\nThe other commonly used flow prevents the client application from ever seeing the user's credentials. For example, you might sign into Pivotal Tracker with your Google account. Your account on Pivotal Tracker doesn't have a password. Instead, it is linked to your Google account - which does. Pivotal Tracker never sees your Google password. When you login to Pivotal Tracker in this way, it takes you to Google's authentication page - owned and operated by Google. When you login successfully, Google gives Pivotal Tracker your token. Pivotal Tracker is now an application that can do things on your behalf.\n\n\nThis is called the \nauthorization code grant\n - or just 'auth code flow'. An instance of \nAuthCodeController\n handles granting authorization codes. Once a code is received, it can be exchanged for a token via an \nAuthController\n.",

            "text": "Most applications have the concept of a user. To prevent just anyone from saying they are this user, the user has a password. When a user wants to use your application, they send their username and password to the server so it can ensure they are who they say they are.  The simple way to do this is to send the username and password in an Authorization header for every request. Two reasons this is bad: first, every time the user wants to do something, their password is sent in every request and that can be unsafe. Second, any application that wants to keep the user logged in has to store that password - and that is unsafe.  In OAuth 2.0, the user gives their username and password to a client application once. The application sends those credentials to a server, and the server gives the application back an access token. A access token is a long, random string that no one can guess. When the user wants to do more stuff, the application sends the token with every request, instead of the user's password. The server checks the token, makes sure its not expired, and then lets the application's request go through. The application doesn't have to store the password and doesn't have to ask the user for their password again.  This credential-for-token exchange happens by sending a POST request to some endpoint, where the username and password are sent in the request body. Typically, an Aqueduct application's route for this is  /auth/token  and handled by an instance of  AuthController .  OAuth 2.0 makes a subtle distinction: a user and the application they are using are not the same thing. It's intuitive to think of a user as \"making a request to the server\", but in reality, the user makes a request to an application and  the application  makes the request to the server. The server  grants  the application access on behalf of the user. In other words, when a user enters their credentials into an application, the application goes to the server and says \"Hey, this user said I can do stuff for them. Look, this is their secret password!\"  This is an important distinction, because an OAuth 2.0 server doesn't just verify users: it also verifies applications. An application has a identifier that has been registered with the server. So, for an ecosystem that has a web client, an Android and an iOS app there would likely be three identifiers - one for each. The client application usually stores that identifier in a database. This identifier is called a  client identifier . Client identifiers are added to Aqueduct applications with the  aqueduct auth  tool (see  Aqueduct Auth CLI ).  When the user is logging in through an application, they submit their username and password. The user doesn't provide the client identifier - in fact, the user doesn't know it. The application sends a request with the user's username and password in the request body, and the client identifier in the Authorization header. All three have to check out for the server to give the application back a token. The full request in pseudo-code looks something like:  var   request   =   HTTPRequest ( /auth/token );  request . method   =   POST ;  request . contentType   =   application/x-www-form-urlencoded ;  request . authorization   =   Base64 . encode ( $ clientID : );  request . body   =   { \n   username   :   bob@stablekernel.com , \n   password   :   supersecretstuff , \n   grant_type   :   password  };   An access token can expire. How long it takes to expire is up to the server - Aqueduct defaults to 24 hours. At first glance, this means that the application would have to ask the user for a password again. But, tokens can also be refreshed. Refreshing a token grants a brand new access token, but without having to ask for the password. This is possible because an access token comes with a  refresh token . The refresh token is another long, random string. So, the JSON the server sends back when granting a token looks like this:  { \n   access_token   :   Abca09zzzza2o2kelmzlli3ijlka , \n   token_type   :   bearer , \n   refresh_token   :   lkmLIAmooa898nm20jannnnnxaww , \n   expire_in   :   3600  }   The application hangs on to both an access token and a refresh token. When the token expires, it will send the refresh token back to the server to get a replacement access token. This is done through the same route that the access token came from -  /auth/token  - except the parameters are a bit different:  var   request   =   HTTPRequest ( /auth/token );  request . method   =   POST ;  request . contentType   =   application/x-www-form-urlencoded ;  request . authorization   =   Base64 . encode ( $ clientID : );  request . body   =   { \n   refresh_token   :   lkmLIAmooa898nm20jannnnnxaww , \n   grant_type   :   refresh_token  };   Exchanging a refresh token has the same response as the initial exchange for username and password - except a few values will have changed.

In practice, this means two things:\n\n\n\n\nA deployed Aqueduct application has zero code differences from an Aqueduct application under test.\n\n\nThere are helpful utilities for writing tests in Aqueduct.\n\n\n\n\nHow Tests are Written\n\n\nAn Aqueduct test suite starts your application with a configuration file specifically built for a test instance of your application. You write test cases that verify the responses of requests sent to this application. Sometimes, you might reach into your application's services to validate that an intended side-effect was triggered. For example, you might ensure that after a request was executed, a row was added to a database table.\n\n\nA \nTestHarness\nT\n is a type from \npackage:aqueduct_test\n that handles the initialization of your application under test. It is often subclassed to add application-specific startup tasks, like seeding a database with test users or adding OAuth 2.0 clients. A test harness is installed at the beginning of your test's \nmain\n function.\n\n\nvoid\n \nmain\n()\n \n{\n\n  \nfinal\n \nharness\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nTestHarness\nMyApplicationChannel\n()..\ninstall\n();\n\n\n  \ntest\n(\nGET /endpoint returns 200 and a simple object\n,\n \n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nfinal\n \nresponse\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nharness\n.\nagent\n.\nget\n(\n/endpoint\n);\n\n    \nexpectResponse\n(\nresponse\n,\n \n200\n,\n \nbody:\n \n{\nkey\n:\n \nvalue\n});\n\n  \n});\n\n\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen \nTestHarness.install\n is invoked, it installs two callbacks that will start your application in 'test mode' when the tests start, and stop it after the tests complete. An application running in 'test mode' creates a local HTTP server and instantiates your \nApplicationChannel\n \non the same isolate as your tests are running on\n. This allows you to reach into your application channel's services to add test expectations on the state that the services manage.\n\n\nWhen your application is started in this way, its options have some default values:\n\n\n\n\nthe application listens on a random port\n\n\nthe \nconfigurationFilePath\n is \nconfig.src.yaml\n\n\n\n\nThe \nconfig.src.yaml\n file must have the same structure as your deployment configurations, but values are substituted with test control values. For example, database connection configuration will point at a local test database instead of a production database. For more details on configuring an application, see \nthis guide\n.\n\n\n\n\nHarness Install\n\n\nThe \ninstall\n method calls \nsetUpAll\n and \ntearDownAll\n from \npackage:test\n to start and stop your application. You can manually start and stop your application by invoking \nTestHarness.start\n and \nTestHarness.stop\n. However, this is not recommended because \nonSetUp\n and \nonTearDown\n will not be called for each test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUncaught Exceptions when Testing\n\n\nA test harness configures the application the let uncaught exceptions escape so that they trigger a failure in your test. This is different than when running an application normally, where all exceptions are caught and send an error response to the HTTP client.\n\n\n\n\nUsing a TestHarness Subclass\n\n\nMost applications should subclass \nTestHarness\nT\n to provide application customization. (Applications created through the CLI have a suclass in \ntest/harness/app.dart\n.) You override callback methods for events that occur during testing, like when the application starts, and before and after each test.\n\n\nclass\n \nHarness\n \nextends\n \nTestHarness\nWildfireChannel\n \n{\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nFuture\n \nonSetUp\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \n// called before each test\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou must invoke \ninstall\n on your test harness at the beginning of test suite for these callbacks to be called.\n\n\nSee \nharness mixins\n for classes that can be mixed into your harness for testing applications that use the ORM or OAuth 2.0.\n\n\nUsing an Agent to Execute Requests\n\n\nA \nTestHarness\nT\n has an \nagent\n property that is used to execute requests against the application being tested. An \nAgent\n has methods like \nget\n and \npost\n to execute requests and return a response object that can be validated. Its usage looks like this:\n\n\ntest\n(\nAfter POST to /thing, GET /thing/:id returns created thing\n,\n \n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n  \nfinal\n \npostResponse\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nharness\n.\nagent\n.\npost\n(\n/thing\n,\n \nbody:\n \n{\nkey\n:\n \nvalue\n});\n\n  \nexpectResponse\n(\npostResponse\n,\n \n200\n);\n\n\n  \nfinal\n \nthingId\n \n=\n \npostResponse\n.\nbody\n.\nas\nMap\n()[\nid\n];\n\n  \nfinal\n \ngetResponse\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nharness\n.\nagent\n.\nget\n(\n/thing/\n$\nthingId\n);\n\n  \nexpectResponse\n(\ngetResponse\n,\n \n200\n,\n \nbody:\n \n{\n\n    \nid\n:\n \nthingId\n,\n\n    \nkey\n:\n \nvalue\n\n  \n});\n\n\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost requests can be configured and executed in methods like \nTestHarness.get\n and \nTestHarness.post\n. For additional configuration options, use \nTestHarness.request\n to create a request object that can be further customized by its properties:\n\n\nfinal\n \nrequest\n \n=\n \nharness\n.\nagent\n.\nrequest\n(\n/endpoint\n)\n\n  \n..\nheaders\n[\nX-Header\n]\n \n=\n \nValue\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a request includes a body, the body is encoded according to the content-type of the request (defaults to JSON). The encoding behavior is provided by \nCodecRegistry\n, the same type that manages encoding and decoding for your application logic. When adding a body to a test request, you provide the unencoded value (a Dart \nMap\n, for example) and it is encoded into the correct value (a JSON object, for example). On the inverse side, when validating a response body, the body is already decoded to a Dart type prior to your test code receiving the response.\n\n\n\n\nCodecs and CodecRegistry\n\n\nYour tests will run on the same isolate as your application. Whatever codecs have been registered in the codec repository by your application are automatically made available to the code that encodes and decodes your tests requests. You don't have to do anything special to opt-in to non-default codecs.\n\n\n\n\nAgents Add Default Values to Requests\n\n\nAn \nAgent\n has defaults values that it applies to requests from it. These values include headers and the request body content-type. For example, you might want all requests to have an extra header value, without having to write the code to add the header for each request.\n\n\nThe default agent of a harness creates requests that have a \napplication/json\n \ncontentType\n. Additional agents can be created for different sets of defaults.\n\n\nThis is especially useful when testing endpoints that require authorization, where credentials need to be attached to each request. This is a common enough task that there are \nharness mixins\n that make this task easier.\n\n\nWriting Test Expectations\n\n\nAfter an agent executes a request, you write test expectations on its response. These expectations include verifying the status code, headers and body of the response are the desired values. Expectations are set by applying matchers to the properties of a response. For example:\n\n\ntest\n(\nGET /foo returns 200 OK\n,\n \n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n  \nfinal\n \nresponse\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nharness\n.\nagent\n.\nget\n(\n/foo\n);\n\n\n  \nexpect\n(\nresponse\n.\nstatusCode\n,\n \n200\n);\n\n  \nexpect\n(\nresponse\n,\n \nhasHeaders\n({\nx-timestamp\n:\n \ngreaterThan\n(\nDateTime\n(\n2020\n))}));\n\n  \nexpect\n(\nresponse\n,\n \nhasBody\n(\nisNull\n));\n\n\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValidating response headers and bodies can be more complex than validating a status code. The \nhasBody\n and \nhasHeaders\n matchers make expectations on the response headers and body easier to write.\n\n\nThe \nhasHeaders\n matcher takes a map of header names and values, and expects that the response's headers contains a matching header for each one in the map. The value may be a \nString\n or another \nMatcher\n. The response can have more headers than expected - those headers are ignored. If you want to exactly specify all headers, there is an optional flag to pass \nhasHeaders\n.\n\n\nThe \nhasBody\n matcher takes any object or matcher that is compared to the \ndecoded\n body of the response. The body is decoded according to its content-type prior to this comparison. For example, if your response returns a JSON object \n{\"key\": \"value\"}\n, this object is first decoded into a Dart \nMap\n with the value \n{'key': 'value'}\n. The following matchers would all be true:\n\n\n// exact match of Dart Map\n\n\nexpect\n(\nresponse\n,\n \nhasBody\n({\nkey\n:\n \nvalue\n}));\n\n\n\n// a map that contains a key whose value starts with \nv\n\n\nexpect\n(\nresponse\n,\n \nhasBody\n({\nkey\n:\n \nstartsWith\n(\nv\n)}));\n\n\n\n// a map that contains the key \nkey\n\n\nexpect\n(\nresponse\n,\n \nhasBody\n(\ncontainsKey\n(\nkey\n)));\n\n\n\n// a map with one entry\n\n\nexpect\n(\nresponse\n,\n \nhasBody\n(\nhasLength\n(\n1\n)));\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor large response bodies where you have other test coverage, you may only want to set expectations for a few values. For example, you might have a map with 50 keys, but all you care about it making sure that \nstatus='pending'\n. For this, there is a \npartial\n map matcher. It behaves similar to \nhasHeaders\n in that it only checks the keys you provide - any other keys are ignored. For example:\n\n\n// Just ensure the body contains an object with at least status=pending, version\n1\n\n\nexpect\n(\nresponse\n,\n \nhasBody\n(\npartial\n({\n\n  \nstatus\n:\n \npending\n,\n\n  \nversion\n:\n \ngreaterThan\n(\n1\n)\n\n\n})));\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen using \npartial\n, you can also ensure that a map doesn't have a key with the \nisNotPresent\n matcher.\n\n\ntest\n(\nGet 200 that at least have these keys\n,\n \n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n  \nvar\n \nresponse\n \n=\n \nawait\n \napp\n.\nclient\n.\nrequest\n(\n/endpoint\n).\nget\n();\n\n  \nexpect\n(\nresponse\n,\n \nhasResponse\n(\n200\n,\n \npartial\n({\n\n    \nkey3\n:\n \nisNotPresent\n\n  \n})));\n\n\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis ensures that \nkey3\n is not in the map. This is different than verifying \nkey3: null\n, which would be true if \nkey3\n's value was actually the null value. See the \nAPI Reference\n for \naqueduct/test\n for more matchers.\n\n\nVerifying Side Effects\n\n\nFor requests that are not idempotent (they change data in some way), you must also verify the state of the data has changed correctly after the request. This is often done by sending another request your application handles to get the updated data. For example, after you create an employee with \nPOST /employees\n, you verify the employee was stored correctly by expecting \nGET /employees/:id\n has the same data you just sent it.\n\n\nSometimes, the expected changes are not accessible through your API. For example, let's say that creating a new employee adds a record to an auditing database, but this database is not accessible through a public API. When testing, however, you would want to ensure that record was added to the database. You can access your application's services (like its database connection) in your tests through \nTestHarness.channel\n. For example, you might execute a \nQuery\nT\n against your application's test database:\n\n\ntest\n(\nPOST /employees adds an audit log record\n,\n \n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n  \nfinal\n \nresponse\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nharness\n.\nagent\n.\npost\n(\n/employees\n,\n \nbody:\n \n{\n\n    \nname\n:\n \nFred\n\n  \n});\n\n\n  \nexpect\n(\nresponse\n,\n \nhasStatus\n(\n202\n));\n\n\n  \nfinal\n \ncontext\n \n=\n \nharness\n.\nchannel\n.\ncontext\n;\n\n  \nfinal\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nQuery\nAuditRecord\n(\ncontext\n)\n\n    \n..\nwhere\n((\nrecord\n)\n \n=\n \nrecord\n.\nuser\n.\nid\n).\nequalTo\n(\nresponse\n.\nbody\n.\nas\nMap\n()[\nid\n]);\n\n  \nfinal\n \nrecord\n \n=\n \nawait\n \nquery\n.\nfetchOne\n();\n\n  \nexpect\n(\nrecord\n,\n \nisNotNull\n);\n\n\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything the \nApplicationChannel\n can access, so too can the tests.\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\nFor testing applications that use OAuth 2.0 or the ORM, see the guide on \nmixins\n for important behavior.",

This allows you to reach into your application channel's services to add test expectations on the state that the services manage.  When your application is started in this way, its options have some default values:   the application listens on a random port  the  configurationFilePath  is  config.src.yaml   The  config.src.yaml  file must have the same structure as your deployment configurations, but values are substituted with test control values. For example, database connection configuration will point at a local test database instead of a production database. For more details on configuring an application, see  this guide .   Harness Install  The  install  method calls  setUpAll  and  tearDownAll  from  package:test  to start and stop your application. You can manually start and stop your application by invoking  TestHarness.start  and  TestHarness.stop . However, this is not recommended because  onSetUp  and  onTearDown  will not be called for each test.    Uncaught Exceptions when Testing  A test harness configures the application the let uncaught exceptions escape so that they trigger a failure in your test. This is different than when running an application normally, where all exceptions are caught and send an error response to the HTTP client.",

An  Agent  has methods like  get  and  post  to execute requests and return a response object that can be validated. Its usage looks like this:  test ( After POST to /thing, GET /thing/:id returns created thing ,   ()   async   { \n   final   postResponse   =   await   harness . agent . post ( /thing ,   body:   { key :   value }); \n   expectResponse ( postResponse ,   200 ); \n\n   final   thingId   =   postResponse . body . as Map ()[ id ]; \n   final   getResponse   =   await   harness . agent . get ( /thing/ $ thingId ); \n   expectResponse ( getResponse ,   200 ,   body:   { \n     id :   thingId , \n     key :   value \n   });  });   Most requests can be configured and executed in methods like  TestHarness.get  and  TestHarness.post . For additional configuration options, use  TestHarness.request  to create a request object that can be further customized by its properties:  final   request   =   harness . agent . request ( /endpoint ) \n   .. headers [ X-Header ]   =   Value ;   When a request includes a body, the body is encoded according to the content-type of the request (defaults to JSON). The encoding behavior is provided by  CodecRegistry , the same type that manages encoding and decoding for your application logic. When adding a body to a test request, you provide the unencoded value (a Dart  Map , for example) and it is encoded into the correct value (a JSON object, for example). On the inverse side, when validating a response body, the body is already decoded to a Dart type prior to your test code receiving the response.   Codecs and CodecRegistry  Your tests will run on the same isolate as your application. Whatever codecs have been registered in the codec repository by your application are automatically made available to the code that encodes and decodes your tests requests. You don't have to do anything special to opt-in to non-default codecs.",

The default agent of a harness creates requests that have a  application/json   contentType . Additional agents can be created for different sets of defaults.  This is especially useful when testing endpoints that require authorization, where credentials need to be attached to each request.

            "text": "After an agent executes a request, you write test expectations on its response. These expectations include verifying the status code, headers and body of the response are the desired values. Expectations are set by applying matchers to the properties of a response. For example:  test ( GET /foo returns 200 OK ,   ()   async   { \n   final   response   =   await   harness . agent . get ( /foo ); \n\n   expect ( response . statusCode ,   200 ); \n   expect ( response ,   hasHeaders ({ x-timestamp :   greaterThan ( DateTime ( 2020 ))})); \n   expect ( response ,   hasBody ( isNull ));  });   Validating response headers and bodies can be more complex than validating a status code. The  hasBody  and  hasHeaders  matchers make expectations on the response headers and body easier to write.  The  hasHeaders  matcher takes a map of header names and values, and expects that the response's headers contains a matching header for each one in the map. The value may be a  String  or another  Matcher . The response can have more headers than expected - those headers are ignored. If you want to exactly specify all headers, there is an optional flag to pass  hasHeaders .  The  hasBody  matcher takes any object or matcher that is compared to the  decoded  body of the response. The body is decoded according to its content-type prior to this comparison. For example, if your response returns a JSON object  {\"key\": \"value\"} , this object is first decoded into a Dart  Map  with the value  {'key': 'value'} . The following matchers would all be true:  // exact match of Dart Map  expect ( response ,   hasBody ({ key :   value }));  // a map that contains a key whose value starts with  v  expect ( response ,   hasBody ({ key :   startsWith ( v )}));  // a map that contains the key  key  expect ( response ,   hasBody ( containsKey ( key )));  // a map with one entry  expect ( response ,   hasBody ( hasLength ( 1 )));   For large response bodies where you have other test coverage, you may only want to set expectations for a few values. For example, you might have a map with 50 keys, but all you care about it making sure that  status='pending' . For this, there is a  partial  map matcher. It behaves similar to  hasHeaders  in that it only checks the keys you provide - any other keys are ignored. For example:  // Just ensure the body contains an object with at least status=pending, version 1  expect ( response ,   hasBody ( partial ({ \n   status :   pending , \n   version :   greaterThan ( 1 )  })));   When using  partial , you can also ensure that a map doesn't have a key with the  isNotPresent  matcher.  test ( Get 200 that at least have these keys ,   ()   async   { \n   var   response   =   await   app . client . request ( /endpoint ). get (); \n   expect ( response ,   hasResponse ( 200 ,   partial ({ \n     key3 :   isNotPresent \n   })));  });   This ensures that  key3  is not in the map. This is different than verifying  key3: null , which would be true if  key3 's value was actually the null value. See the  API Reference  for  aqueduct/test  for more matchers.",

This is often done by sending another request your application handles to get the updated data. For example, after you create an employee with  POST /employees , you verify the employee was stored correctly by expecting  GET /employees/:id  has the same data you just sent it.  Sometimes, the expected changes are not accessible through your API. For example, let's say that creating a new employee adds a record to an auditing database, but this database is not accessible through a public API. When testing, however, you would want to ensure that record was added to the database. You can access your application's services (like its database connection) in your tests through  TestHarness.channel . For example, you might execute a  Query T  against your application's test database:  test ( POST /employees adds an audit log record ,   ()   async   { \n   final   response   =   await   harness . agent . post ( /employees ,   body:   { \n     name :   Fred \n   }); \n\n   expect ( response ,   hasStatus ( 202 )); \n\n   final   context   =   harness . channel . context ; \n   final   query   =   new   Query AuditRecord ( context ) \n     .. where (( record )   =   record . user . id ). equalTo ( response . body . as Map ()[ id ]); \n   final   record   =   await   query . fetchOne (); \n   expect ( record ,   isNotNull );  });   Anything the  ApplicationChannel  can access, so too can the tests.",

The blue right/downward arrow continues execution into the function that is about to be called and stops on its first line.  The red right/downward arrow is the same as above, but will also jump into dependency code.  The blue right/upwards arrow completes execution of the current method and stops right after the callsite.   Note that currently asynchronous invocations confuse the debugger a bit. To continue past an asynchronous method to the next line, set a breakpoint on that next line and hit the big green arrow on the left column of buttons.  To jump into an asynchronous method, command-click on its definition and set a breakpoint on its first line and then click the big green arrow.",

For example, an application might make requests to the GitHub API to collect analytics about a team's workflow. When running automated tests, consuming the actual GitHub API isn't feasible - because GitHub will probably rate limit you and because the data being returned is constantly changing.\n\n\nTo solve this problem, you can create \"mocks\" of a service during testing. Aqueduct has two testing utilities for this purpose - \nMockServer\n and \nMockHTTPServer\n - in the \naqueduct/test\n library.\n\n\nUsing a MockHTTPServer\n\n\nWhen testing your application, you send it requests using a \nTestClient\n. As part of the request handling logic, your application might issue requests to some other server. \nMockHTTPServer\n allows you to validate that the request your application sent was correct and gives you control what the responses are to those requests. For example, \ngithubMock\n is an instance of \nMockHTTPServer\n in the following test, which ensures that the request was constructed correctly:\n\n\ntest\n(\nWill get correct user from GitHub\n,\n \n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n  \nvar\n \nresponse\n \n=\n\n    \nawait\n \napp\n.\nclient\n.\nauthenticatedRequest\n(\n/github_profile/fred\n).\nget\n();\n\n\n  \nvar\n \nrequestSentByYourApplicationToGitHub\n \n=\n \nawait\n \ngithubMock\n.\nnext\n();\n\n  \nexpect\n(\nrequestSentByYourApplicationToGitHub\n.\nmethod\n,\n \nGET\n);\n\n  \nexpect\n(\nrequestSentByYourApplicationToGitHub\n.\npath\n,\n \n/users/search?name=fred\n);\n\n\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above code, we are expecting that anytime the request \nGET /github_profile/fred\n is sent to your application, that it turns around and searches for a user in GitHub's API. This test ensures that we have correctly translated our request to a request to be made to the GitHub API. If no request was made - because of a programmer error - this test would fail because the \nFuture\n returned from \ngithubMock.next()\n would never complete. There is no next request, because none was ever delivered!\n\n\nBy default, any request sent to a \nMockHTTPServer\n is a 200 OK Response with an empty body. You may change this behavior by queuing responses in a mock server.\n\n\ntest\n(\nWill get correct user from GitHub\n,\n \n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n  \ngithubMock\n.\nqueueResponse\n(\nnew\n \nResponse\n.\nok\n({\nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n \nname\n:\n \nfred\n}));\n\n\n  \nvar\n \nresponse\n \n=\n\n    \nawait\n \napp\n.\nclient\n.\nauthenticatedRequest\n(\n/github_profile/fred\n).\nget\n();\n\n  \nexpect\n(\nresponse\n,\n \nhasResponse\n(\n200\n,\n \npartial\n({\n\n    \nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n    \nname\n:\n \nfred\n\n  \n})))\n\n\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above code, \nqueueResponse\n adds a 200 OK Response to the mock server queue with a specific body. The mock server will send that response for the next request it receives. In the implementation of \n/github_profile/fred\n, your application sends a \nGET /users/search?name=fred\n to the GitHub API - except the GitHub API is your mock server, and it returns the response you queued instead. Thus, the queued up response is the expected response of the GitHub API.\n\n\nAfter the request completes, the response is removed from the queue and subsequent responses will go back to the default. You may queue as many responses as you like. You may also simulate a failed request - one that never gets a response - like so:\n\n\nmockServer\n.\nqueueResponse\n(\nMockHTTPServer\n.\nmockConnectionFailureResponse\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also subclass \nMockHTTPServer\n and override its \nopen\n method to add logic to determine the response. Please see the implementation of \nMockHTTPServer.open\n for more details.\n\n\nConfiguring a MockHTTPServer\n\n\nA \nMockHTTPServer\n is created when setting up tests. It must be closed when tearing down tests. If you use the same mock server to across all tests (e.g., open it in \nsetUpAll\n), make sure to clear it after each test:\n\n\nimport\n \npackage:aqueduct/test.dart\n;\n\n\n\nvoid\n \nmain\n()\n \n{\n\n  \nvar\n \nmockServer\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nMockHTTPServer\n(\n4000\n);\n\n\n  \nsetUpAll\n(()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nawait\n \nmockServer\n.\nopen\n();\n\n  \n});\n\n\n  \ntearDownAll\n(()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nawait\n \nmockServer\n.\nclose\n();\n\n  \n});\n\n\n  \ntearDown\n(()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nmockServer\n.\nclear\n();\n\n  \n});\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn instance of \nMockHTTPServer\n listens on localhost on a specific port. An application that makes testable external service requests should provide the base URI for those services in a configuration file. The URI for that service in the \nconfiguration file used during testing\n should point at localhost and a specific port. For example, if a deployed \nconfig.yaml\n file has the following key-values:\n\n\ngithub\n:\n\n  \nbaseURL\n:\n \nhttps\n://\napi\n.\ngithub\n.\ncom\n/\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThen \nconfig.src.yaml\n would have:\n\n\ngithub\n:\n\n  \nbaseURL\n:\n \nhttp\n://\nlocalhost\n:\n4000\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour application reads this configuration file and injects the base URL into the service that will execute requests.\n\n\nclass\n \nAppConfiguration\n \nextends\n \nConfiguration\n \n{\n\n  \nAppConfiguration\n(\nString\n \nfileName\n)\n \n:\n \nsuper\n.\nfromFile\n(\nfileName\n);\n\n\n  \nAPIConfiguration\n \ngithub\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nclass\n \nAppApplicationChannel\n \nextends\n \nApplicationChannel\n \n{\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nFuture\n \nprepare\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nvar\n \nconfig\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nAppConfiguration\n(\noptions\n.\nconfigurationFilePath\n);\n\n\n    \ngithubService\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nGitHubService\n(\nbaseURL:\n \nconfig\n.\ngithub\n.\nbaseURL\n);\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that \nAPIConfiguration\n is an existing type and is meant for this purpose.\n\n\nAlso note that the testing strategy for database connections is \nnot\n to use a mock but to use a temporary, local database that is set up and torn down during tests.

Note that there is a DATABASE_URL environment variable that is the connection details for your PostgreSQL database. You won't need to remember the value, only that this environment variable exists.\n\n\nStep 2: Setting up an Aqueduct Application to Run on Heroku\n\n\nIf you have not yet, create a new Aqueduct application on your local machine, go into that directory, and initialize it as a git repository if it is not already:\n\n\naqueduct create app_name\n\ncd\n app_name\ngit init\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the following commands to configure your project in Heroku's environment.\n\n\n\n\nHeroku Application Name\n\n\nIn the following commands, ensure that \napp_name\n is the name of your \nHeroku application\n created in their web portal, not the name of your Aqueduct application.\n\n\n\n\n# This is an interactive command that you have to enter your username and password.\n\nheroku login\n\n\n# This adds a remote repository hosted by Heroku for your application that you push to.\n\nheroku git:remote -a app_name\n\n\n# Specifies the Dart SDK to use\n\nheroku config:set \nDART_SDK_URL\n=\nhttps://storage.googleapis.com/dart-archive/channels/stable/release/latest/sdk/dartsdk-linux-x64-release.zip\n\n\n# Specifies the Heroku Buildpack to use\n\nheroku config:set \nBUILDPACK_URL\n=\nhttps://github.com/stablekernel/heroku-buildpack-dart.git\n\n\n# Specifies that aqueduct should be activated\n\nheroku config:set \nDART_GLOBAL_PACKAGES\n=\naqueduct@3.0.0\n\nheroku config:set \nPATH\n=\n/app/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/app/.pub-cache/bin:/app/dart-sdk/bin\nheroku config:set \nPUB_CACHE\n=\n/app/pub-cache\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, create a new file in your project directory named \nProcfile\n (with no suffix) and enter the following:\n\n\nrelease: /app/dart-sdk/bin/pub global run aqueduct:aqueduct db upgrade --connect $DATABASE_URL\nweb: /app/dart-sdk/bin/pub global run aqueduct:aqueduct serve --port $PORT --config-path heroku.yaml\n\n\n\n\n\nThis file tells Heroku how to run your application, and to execute any database migrations each time you push a release. Make sure this file is checked into version control:\n\n\ngit commit -am \nAdds Procfile\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Configuring Application Values\n\n\nHeroku provides configuration values through environment variables. In our \nProcfile\n, we indicated that we will use a file named \nheroku.yaml\n for configuration. This file will map configuration values in our application to environment variables in the Heroku platform. Your configuration file may vary, but it is important to note that if you are using a database, the database credentials are provided through a \nconnection string\n. A connection string looks like this: \npostgres://user:password@host:5432/name\n and by default, Heroku stores it in the environment variable named \nDATABASE_URL\n.\n\n\nIn \nheroku.yaml\n (which you will need to create in your project directory), you can reference an environment variable by prefixing its name with a \n$\n. When using the built-in \nDatabaseConfiguration\n type, you can assign the connection string like so:\n\n\ndatabase\n:\n \n$DATABASE_URL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour heroku.yaml might be different\n\n\nMake sure the structure of your \nheroku.yaml\n file matches the expected structure in your application's \nConfiguration\n subclass.\n\n\n\n\nCheck \nheroku.yaml\n into version control.\n\n\ngit commit -am \nadd heroku.yaml\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Running the Aqueduct Application\n\n\nIf your application uses a database, make sure you have generated your migration file(s) and added it to version control. The \nProcfile\n will ensure that database is up to date with any migrations checked into source control before running your app. Generate your migration file with the following command from your project directory and then check it into version control:\n\n\naqueduct db generate\ngit commit -am \nadds migration files\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, you can deploy your application. It's as simple as this:\n\n\ngit push heroku master\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command pushes your code to a remote git server hosted by Heroku, which triggers your application to run its release script.\n\n\nNow that your application's database schema has been uploaded, you can configure your OAuth 2 server with client identifiers if you are using \npackage:aqueduct/managed_auth\n. The following command will run within your application's remote environment.\n\n\nheroku run /app/dart-sdk/bin/pub global run aqueduct:aqueduct auth add-client --id com.app.standard --secret secret --connect \n\\$\nDATABASE_URL\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, scale up a dyno and the application will start receiving requests:\n\n\nheroku ps:scale \nweb\n=\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow your application is running!",

This is often the case for Amazon Web Service (AWS) EC2 instances, Google Cloud Compute Instances, Azure Virtual Machines, and rented boxes on platforms like Digital Ocean or other cloud providers.\n\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with deploying applications in this way, this is not a good beginner's guide and will not cover many of the steps necessary to deploy an application. Prefer to use a platform like Heroku or one that supports Docker. See the guides on \nHeroku\n and \nDocker\n for better options.\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nAqueduct applications are run by using \naqueduct serve\n or \ndart bin/main.dart\n.\n\n\n# in project directory\naqueduct serve\n\n# or\n\n# in project directory\ndart bin/main.dart\n\n\n\n\n\nThe target machine must have Dart installed. If you are using \naqueduct serve\n, you must also activate the CLI on the target machine:\n\n\npub global activate aqueduct\n\n\n\n\n\nYour source code must also be available on the target machine. You can transfer your source to a machine with tools like \nftp\n, \nscp\n, \nrsync\n and \ngit\n.\n\n\nAqueduct will listen on port 8888 by default.

These documents are JSON objects that follow a specification. This specification defines which properties the document can (or must) have. By following this specification, your application can take advantage of tools such as documentation viewers and source code generators.\n\n\nThe two most important objects in an OpenAPI document are components and path operations. A path operation contains an expected request and possible responses. Components are reusable definitions that you can use in a path operation. For example, a 400 Bad Request response component can be reused across path operations that may send this response.\n\n\nMost of the documentation process revolves around registering components and creating path operations.\n\n\nThe aqueduct document Command\n\n\nDocuments can be written by hand, but it takes a lot of time and is hard to keep in sync with your code. Aqueduct analyzes your code to build (most) of a document for you. You run the \naqueduct document\n command in your project's directory, and it prints the JSON document to your console.\n\n\ncd\n my_project/\naqueduct document\n\n-- Aqueduct CLI Version: \n3\n.0.0\n-- Aqueduct project version: \n3\n.0.0\n\n{\nopenapi\n:\n3.0.0\n,\ninfo\n:...\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may copy the output to use it in another tool; for example, by entering it into \nSwagger Editor\n. If you want to build a tool that runs this command, but don't want to parse the version info from the output, use the \n--machine\n flag.\n\n\naqueduct document --machine\n\n{\nopenapi\n:\n3.0.0\n,\ninfo\n:...\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch of the metadata in an OpenAPI document - such as title or version - is derived from your application's \npubspec.yaml\n. If you want to override the derived values, or provide values that can't be derived, use options like \n--title\n or \n--license-name\n. See \naqueduct document --help\n for all options.\n\n\nHow Applications are Documented\n\n\nWhen you run the \naqueduct document\n command, it creates an empty \nAPIDocument\n that objects in your application will populate. Your application goes through its normal initialization process (i.e., \nprepare\n and \nentryPoint\n). Controllers and service objects are then told to register components. For example, all \nManagedObject\ns register themselves as a reusable schema component. After components are registered, the controllers in an application are told to create path operations that define the requests they handle.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration Files\n\n\nBecause your application goes through initialization as if it were going to run the application, you must have a valid configuration file when documenting. This defaults to 'config.yaml.src', the same file you use for running tests. See \naqueduct document --help\n to use a different file.\n\n\n\n\nDocumenting Components\n\n\nObjects that register components implement \nAPIComponentDocumenter.documentComponents\n. Controllers - which implement this method - automatically document their components as long as they are linked to your application's entry point. Other types of objects that implement this method will be automatically documented if they are declared as a property of your \nApplicationChannel\n.\n\n\nFor example, in the following code, the \nAuthServer\n, \nRouter\n and \nPathController\n all automatically document their components.\n\n\nclass\n \nMyChannel\n \nextends\n \nApplicationChannel\n \n{\n\n  \nAuthServer\n \nauthServer\n;\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nFuture\n \nprepare\n()\n \nasync\n \n{\n\n    \nauthServer\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nAuthServer\n(...);\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nController\n \nget\n \nentryPoint\n \n{\n\n    \nfinal\n \nrouter\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nRouter\n();\n\n    \nrouter\n.\nroute\n(\n/path\n).\nlink\n(()\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nPathController\n());\n\n    \nreturn\n \nrouter\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn most applications, the automatically documented objects are the only objects that register components. If you have an object that needs to register components, but aren't automatically documented, override \ndocumentComponents\n in your app channel to tell that object to register components. You must call the superclass' implementation.\n\n\nclass\n \nMyChannel\n \nextends\n \nApplicationChannel\n \n{\n\n  \n...\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nvoid\n \ndocumentComponents\n(\nAPIDocumentContext\n \ncontext\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nsuper\n.\ndocumentComponents\n(\ncontext\n);\n\n\n    \nobjectWithComponents\n.\ndocumentComponents\n(\ncontext\n);\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can override \ndocumentComponents\n in controllers and services that you create. Read the \nguide on component documentation\n for more details.\n\n\nDocument Path Operations\n\n\nA path operation is the expected request and possible responses for a path (e.g., \n/users\n) and its request method (e.g., \nGET\n). Each operation describes how to send a request to the server, like which headers or query parameters to include. Responses describe the status code, headers and body that can be sent. Each controller implements \nAPIOperationDocumenter.documentOperations\n to define this information for the requests it handles.\n\n\nBuilt-in controllers like \nAuthorizer\n and \nResourceController\n already implement this method. You typically only override this method when creating your own middleware. For more information on documenting middleware, see \nthis guide\n.\n\n\nWhen creating documentation for \nResourceController\ns, request parameters are derived from your bindings, but you still need to provide the possible responses.

The context stores the document being created, but more importantly, is a container for reusable components. You may register components by implementing \nAPIComponentDocumenter\n and implementing its abstract method. For example, the following code registers a reusable schema object:\n\n\nclass\n \nSourceRepository\n \nimplements\n \nAPIComponentDocumenter\n \n{\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nvoid\n \ndocumentComponents\n(\nAPIDocumentContext\n \ncontext\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nsuper\n.\ndocumentComponents\n(\ncontext\n);\n\n\n    \ncontext\n.\nschema\n.\nregister\n(\nSourceRepository\n,\n\n        \nAPISchemaObject\n.\nobject\n({\n\n          \nid\n:\n \nAPISchemaObject\n.\ninteger\n(),\n\n          \nname\n:\n \nAPISchemaObject\n.\nstring\n()\n\n        \n});\n          \n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA \"SourceRepository\" is an object that contains two fields, \"id\" (an integer) and \"name\" (a string). This component can be used anywhere a schema object can be used. Schema objects are one type of component that document what is typically considered to be a 'model object'. You most often see schema objects in request and response bodies. By default, each of your \nManagedObject\ns are registered as schema objects. The other types of components are: responses, request bodies, parameters, headers, security schemes, and callbacks.\n\n\nComponents must be registered with a name, but can additionally be registered with a type. This allows users of a component to reference it by its Dart type. Including a type reference for an object is an optional argument when registering.\n\n\ncontext\n.\nschema\n.\nregister\n(\nSourceRepository\n,\n\n    \nAPISchemaObject\n.\nobject\n({\n\n      \nid\n:\n \nAPISchemaObject\n.\ninteger\n(),\n\n      \nname\n:\n \nAPISchemaObject\n.\nstring\n()\n\n    \n},\n \nrepresentation:\n \nSourceRepository\n);\n          \n\n\n\n\n\nThe order in which components are registered and referenced does not matter. If you reference a component that is created later in the documentation process, it will be resolved prior to the document being completed. If a referenced component is never registered, an error is thrown and your document will fail to generate.\n\n\nUsing Components\n\n\nComponents can be used when declaring path operations, or as part of other components. For example, if you were to describe a response whose body was a component named \"SourceRepository\", it would look like this:\n\n\nclass\n \nRepositoryController\n \nextends\n \nResourceController\n \n{\n\n  \n...\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nMap\nString\n,\n \nAPIResponse\n \ndocumentOperationResponses\n(\nAPIDocumentContext\n \ncontext\n,\n \nOperation\n \noperation\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nif\n \n(\noperation\n.\nmethod\n \n==\n \nGET\n)\n \n{\n\n      \nreturn\n \n{\n\n        \n200\n:\n \nAPIResponse\n.\nschema\n(\ncontext\n.\nschema\n[\nSourceRepository\n])\n\n      \n};\n\n    \n}\n\n    \nreturn\n \nnull\n;\n\n  \n}\n  \n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf an object has been registered by its type, you may use \ngetObjectWithType\n.\n\n\nclass\n \nRepositoryController\n \nextends\n \nResourceController\n \n{\n\n  \n...\n\n\n  \n@\noverride\n\n  \nMap\nString\n,\n \nAPIResponse\n \ndocumentOperationResponses\n(\nAPIDocumentContext\n \ncontext\n,\n \nOperation\n \noperation\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nif\n \n(\noperation\n.\nmethod\n \n==\n \nGET\n)\n \n{\n\n      \nreturn\n \n{\n\n        \n200\n:\n \nAPIResponse\n.\nschema\n(\ncontext\n.\nschema\n.\ngetObjectWithType\n(\nSourceRepository\n))\n\n      \n};\n\n    \n}\n\n    \nreturn\n \nnull\n;\n\n  \n}\n  \n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent Discovery\n\n\nAll controllers are can document components when they are linked to the entry point. Objects other than controllers will automatically document their components if they implement \nAPIComponentDocumenter\n \nand\n are declared properties of your \nApplicationChannel\n. (See \nthis guide\n for other options.)\n\n\nBuilt-in Aqueduct types will register any applicable components. This includes the types that handle OAuth2 as well as all \nManagedObject\n subclasses in your application.\n\n\nManagedObject Discovery\n\n\nDeclaring a \nManagedContext\n as a property of your \nApplicationChannel\n will automatically document the managed objects of your application as schema components.\n\n\nSerializable Discovery\n\n\nIf a \nSerializable\n object is bound to a request body in a \nResourceController\n, it will automatically be documented as a schema component. By default, the properties of the \nSerializable\n object are reflected on to produce this component. To override this behavior and provide your own component documentation, implement the following method in your \nSerializable\n subclass:\n\n\nclass\n \nPerson\n \nextends\n \nSerializable\n \n{\n\n  \nString\n \nname\n;\n\n\n  \nMap\nString\n,\n \ndynamic\n \nasMap\n()\n \n=\n \n{\nname\n:\n \nname\n};\n\n  \nvoid\n \nreadFromMap\n(\nMap\nString\n,\n \ndynamic\n \nmap\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nname\n \n=\n \nmap\n[\nname\n];\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \nAPISchemaObject\n \ndocumentSchema\n(\nAPIDocumentContext\n \ncontext\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \nAPISchemaObject\n.\nobject\n(\nproperties:\n \n{\n\n      \nname\n:\n \nAPISchemaObject\n.\nstring\n()\n\n    \n});\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you \nSerializable\n type is not bound to a resource controller operation, you must register it yourself.

The context stores the document being created, but more importantly, is a container for reusable components. You may register components by implementing  APIComponentDocumenter  and implementing its abstract method. For example, the following code registers a reusable schema object:  class   SourceRepository   implements   APIComponentDocumenter   { \n   @ override \n   void   documentComponents ( APIDocumentContext   context )   { \n     super . documentComponents ( context ); \n\n     context . schema . register ( SourceRepository , \n         APISchemaObject . object ({ \n           id :   APISchemaObject . integer (), \n           name :   APISchemaObject . string () \n         });           \n   }  }   A \"SourceRepository\" is an object that contains two fields, \"id\" (an integer) and \"name\" (a string). This component can be used anywhere a schema object can be used. Schema objects are one type of component that document what is typically considered to be a 'model object'. You most often see schema objects in request and response bodies. By default, each of your  ManagedObject s are registered as schema objects. The other types of components are: responses, request bodies, parameters, headers, security schemes, and callbacks.  Components must be registered with a name, but can additionally be registered with a type. This allows users of a component to reference it by its Dart type. Including a type reference for an object is an optional argument when registering.  context . schema . register ( SourceRepository , \n     APISchemaObject . object ({ \n       id :   APISchemaObject . integer (), \n       name :   APISchemaObject . string () \n     },   representation:   SourceRepository );             The order in which components are registered and referenced does not matter. If you reference a component that is created later in the documentation process, it will be resolved prior to the document being completed. If a referenced component is never registered, an error is thrown and your document will fail to generate.",
