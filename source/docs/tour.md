# Aqueduct: A Tour

Create applications with the `aqueduct` tool:

```
aqueduct create my_app
```

Run applications by using the `aqueduct` tool in a project directory:

```
aqueduct serve
```

### Structure

An Aqueduct application is a series of controllers that form a *channel* for a request to flow through. Any of those controllers may respond to a request and take it out of the channel. Controllers in the middle of the channel often verify something, while the controller at the end fulfills the request. Fulfillment might mean returning the contents of a file or storing data from the request body in a database.

### Initialization

An application's channel is created by subclassing [RequestSink](http/request_sink.md). This type also performs any other application initialization, like creating database connections and defining how authorization occurs.

```dart
import 'package:aqueduct/aqueduct.dart';

class AppRequestSink extends RequestSink {
  AppRequestSink(ApplicationConfiguration config) : super(config) {
    databaseContext = contextFrom(config);
  }

  @override
  void setupRouter(Router router) {
    router
      .route("/resource/[:id]")
      .generate(() => new ResourceController(databaseContext));
  }
}
```

### Routing

A [router](http/routing.md) splits a channel into sub-channels based on the path of a request. A request with the path `/users` will be handled by a different controller than a request with the path `/posts`, for example. Routes are defined by *route specification syntax*. Routes can contain variables and optional segments, enabling routes to be grouped together.

```dart
@override
void setupRouter(Router router) {    
  router
    .route("/users/[:id]")
    .generate(() => new UserController());

  router
    .route("/file/*")
    .generate(() => new HTTPFileController());

  router
    .route("/health")
    .listen((req) async => new Response.ok(null));
}    
```

### Controllers

[HTTPController](http/http_controller.md) are the controller that most often fulfill a request. An `HTTPController` subclass handles all operations for resource, e.g. `POST /users`, `GET /users` and `GET /users/1`.

Subclasses implement a *operation method* for each operation:

```dart
import 'package:aqueduct/aqueduct.dart'

class ResourceController extends HTTPController {
  @Bind.get()
  Future<Response> getAllResources() async {
    return new Response.ok(await fetchResources());
  }

  @Bind.get()
  Future<Response> getResourceByID(@Bind.path("id") int id) async {
    return new Response.ok(await fetchResource(id));
  }

  @Bind.post()
  Future<Response> createResource(@Bind.body() Resource resource) async {
    var inserted = await insertResource(resource);
    return new Response.ok(inserted);
  }
}
```

Properties of the request are bound to operation method arguments and controller properties:

```dart
class ResourceController extends HTTPController {
  @Bind.get()
  Future<Response> getAllResources(
      @Bind.header("x-request-id") String requestID,
      {@Bind.query("limit") int limit}) async {
    return new Response.ok(await fetchResources(limit ?? 0));
  }

  @Bind.post()
  Future<Response> createResource(@Bind.body() Resource resource) async {
    var inserted = await insertResourceIntoDatabase(resource);
    return new Response.ok(inserted);
  }
}
```

`ManagedObjectController<T>`s are `HTTPController`s that automatically map a REST interface to database queries:

```dart
router
  .route("/users/[:id]")
  .generate(() => new ManagedObjectController<User>());
```

`RequestController` is the base class for all controllers that form a channel. They only have a single method to handle the request, and must either return the request or a response. When a request controller returns a response, the request is taken out of the channel.

```dart
class VerifyingController extends RequestController {
  @override
  Future<RequestOrResponse> processRequest(Request request) async {
    if (request.innerRequest.headers.value("x-secret-key") == "secret!") {
      return request;
    }

    return new Response.badRequest();
  }
}
```

This behavior lets a channel prevent invalid requests from being fulfilled, or let's a controller be reused in multiple places to provide some preprocessing step.

Uncaught exceptions are caught by the controller and translated into an appropriate response, removing the request from the channel. Exceptions should only be caught when another response is desired or when the request should continue to the next controller in the channel.

### Configuration

Read YAML configuration data into type-safe and name-safe structures at startup:

```
// config.yaml
database:
  host: ...
  port: 5432
  databaseName: foo
otherOption: hello
numberOfDoodads: 3  
```

Subclass `ConfigurationItem` and declare a property for each key in the configuration file:

```dart
class AppOptions extends ConfigurationItem {
  AppOptions(String path) : super.fromFile(path);

  DatabaseConnectionInfo database;
  String otherOption;
  int numberOfDoodads;
}
```

Read the configuration file identified by an `ApplicationConfiguration`:

```dart
import 'package:aqueduct/aqueduct.dart';

class AppRequestSink extends RequestSink {
  AppRequestSink(ApplicationConfig config) : super(config) {
    var options = new AppOptions(config.configurationFilePath);
    ...
  }
}
```

### Running and Concurrency

Aqueduct applications are run with the `aqueduct serve` command line tool, which can also open debugging and instrumentation tools and specify how many threads the application should run on:

```
aqueduct serve --observe --isolates 5
```

Run applications detached or still connected to the shell:

```
aqueduct serve --detached --port $PORT
```

Aqueduct applications are multi-isolate (multi-threaded). Each isolate runs a replica of the same web server with its own set of services like database connections. This makes behavior like database connection pooling implicit.

### Querying a Database

Database operations are built and executed with instances of `Query<T>`.

```dart
import 'package:aqueduct/aqueduct.dart'

class ResourceController extends HTTPController {
  @Bind.get()
  Future<Response> getAllResources() async {
    var query = new Query<Resource>();

    var results = await query.fetch();

    return new Response.ok(results);
  }
}
```

The results can be filtered by the `Query.where` property, which has the same properties as the object being queried.

```dart
var query = new Query<Employee>()
  ..where.name = whereStartsWith("Sa")
  ..where.salary = whereGreaterThan(50000);
var results = await query.fetch();
```

Values set on the properties of `Query.values` are sent to the database on insert and update operations. Like `Query.where`, `Query.values` has the same properties as the object being inserted or updated.

```dart
var query = new Query<Employee>()
  ..values.name = "Bob"
  ..values.salary = 50000;

var bob = await query.insert();  

var updateQuery = new Query<Employee>()
  ..where.id = bob.id
  ..values.name = "Bobby";
bob = await updateQuery.updateOne();  
```

`Query<T>`s can sort and page on a result set. It can also join tables and return objects and their relationships:

```dart
var query = new Query<Employee>()
  ..where.name = "Sue Gallagher"
  ..join(object: (e) => e.manager)
  ..join(set: (e) => e.directReports);

var herAndHerManagerAndHerDirectReports = await query.fetchOne();
```

Exceptions thrown for queries are caught by a controller and translated into the appropriate status code. Unique constraint conflicts return 409,
missing required properties return 400 and database connection failure returns 503.

### Defining a Data Model

`ManagedObject<T>` instances represent a row in a database; each property is a column in the corresponding table. This class is always subclassed and is in fact made up of two classes:

```dart
class Employee extends ManagedObject<_Employee> implements _Employee {
  bool get wasRecentlyHired => hireDate.difference(new DateTime.now()).inDays < 30;
}
class _Employee  {
  @managedPrimaryKey
  int index;

  @ManagedColumnAttributes(indexed: true)
  String name;

  DateTime hireDate;
  int salary;
}
```

`ManagedObject<T>`s have relationship properties for has-one, has-many and many-to-many references to other `ManagedObject<T>`s. The property with `ManagedRelationship` metadata is a foreign key column.

```dart
class Employee extends ManagedObject<_Employee> implements _Employee {}
class _Employee {
  ...

  ManagedSet<Initiative> initiatives;
}

class Initiative extends ManagedObject<_Initiative> implements _Initiative {}
class _Initiative {
  ...

  @ManagedRelationship(#initiatives)
  Employee leader;
}
```

`ManagedObject<T>`s are easily read from and written to JSON (or any other format):

```dart
class UserController extends HTTPController {
  @Bind.put()
  Future<Response> updateUser(@Bind.path("id") int id, @Bind.body() User user) async {
    var query = new Query<User>()
      ..where.id = id
      ..values = user;

    var updatedUser = await query.updateOne();

    return new Response.ok(updatedUser);
  }
}
```

### Automatic Database Migration

Generate and run database migrations with the `aqueduct db` tool:

```
aqueduct db generate
aqueduct db validate
aqueduct db upgrade --connect postgres@://...
```

### OAuth 2.0

Authentication and authorization are enabled at application startup by creating an `AuthServer` with `ManagedAuthStorage`:

```dart
import 'package:aqueduct/aqueduct.dart';
import 'package:aqueduct/managed_auth.dart';

class AppRequestSink extends RequestSink {
  AppRequestSink(ApplicationConfig config) : super(config) {
    var storage = new ManagedAuthStorage<User>(ManagedContext.defaultContext);
    authServer = new AuthServer(storage);
  }

  AuthServer authServer;
}
```

Set up routes to exchange credentials for tokens using `AuthController` and `AuthCodeController`. Add `Authorizer`s between routes and their controller to restrict access to authorized resource owners only:

```dart
void setupRouter(Router router) {
  router
    .route("/auth/token")
    .generate(() => new AuthController(authServer));

  router
    .route("/auth/code")
    .generate(() => new AuthCodeController(authServer));

  router
    .route("/protected")
    .pipe(new Authorizer.bearer(authServer))
    .generate(() => new ProtectedController());
}
```

Insert OAuth 2.0 clients into a database:

```
aqueduct auth add-client --id com.app.mobile --secret foobar --redirect-uri https://somewhereoutthere.com
```

### Logging

All requests are logged to an instance of `Logger`. Set up a listener for logger in `RequestSink` to print log messages to the console. (See also [scribe](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/scribe) for logging to rotating files.)


```dart
class WildfireSink extends RequestSink {
  WildfireSink(ApplicationConfiguration config) : super(config) {
    logger.onRecord.listen((record) {
      print("$record");
    });
  }
}
```

### Testing

Tests are run by starting the Aqueduct application and verifying responses in a test file. A test harness is included in projects generated from `aqueduct create` that starts and stops a test instance of your application and uploads your database schema to a temporary, local database.

```dart
import 'harness/app.dart';

void main() {
  var app = new TestApplication();

  setUpAll(() async {
    await app.start();
  });

  test("...", () async {
    var response = await app.client.request("/endpoint").get();
    ...
  });
}
```

A `TestClient` executes requests configured for the locally running test instance of your application. Instances of `TestResponse` are returned and can be evaluated with matchers like any other Dart tests. There are special matchers specifically for Aqueduct.

```dart
test("POST /users creates a user", () async {
  var request = app.client.request("/users")
    ..json = {"email": "bob@stablekernel.com"};
  var response = await request.post();

  expect(response, hasResponse(200, {
    "id": isNumber,
    "email": "bob@stablekernel.com"
  }));
});

test("GET /users/1 returns a user", () async {
  var response = await app.client.authenticatedRequest("/users/1").get();
  expect(response, hasResponse(200, partial({
    "email": "bob@stablekernel.com"
  })));
});
```
