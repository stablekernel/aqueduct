## Project creation

To use this template, from the command line, enter `aqueduct create -t db_and_auth <project name>`. 
## Database

You will need a new database specific for your app. 

The tests are run with a local PostgreSQL database named `dart_test`. If this test database does not exist, create it from your SQL prompt.

If your app uses the same database as the test database, you'll get conflicts. The test database is cleared of all tables after your tests run. See [http://aqueduct.io/docs/testing/mixins/](http://aqueduct.io/docs/testing/mixins/).

So create a database named after their project.
 
```
CREATE DATABASE dart_test;
CREATE USER dart WITH createdb;
ALTER USER dart WITH password 'dart';
GRANT all ON DATABASE dart_test TO dart;
```

## Setup instructions

### Database connection info

You must have a `config.yaml` file that has correct database connection info, which should point to a local database. To configure a database to match your application's schema, run the following commands:

Remember, you have to create a new database for the app. 
```
# Note: if this is a new project, run db generate first, assuming you setup the `dart_test` db with `userid:password` of `dart:dart`.
aqueduct db generate
aqueduct db upgrade --connect postgres://dart:dart@localhost:5432/wildfire
```

### Configure OAuth

You must also configure OAuth 2.0 Client identifiers in this database.

```
aqueduct auth add-client --id com.local.test \
    --secret mysecret \
    --connect postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/wildfire
```

## Running the server

Run `aqueduct serve` from this directory to run the application. For running within an IDE, run `bin/main.dart`.

## Running CURL commands to test the end points

The following CURL commands will be hitting the end points that are defined in `channel.dart`.

### Client Authentication

Notice above that we have an client identifier of `com.local.test` with the secret `mysecret`. We will need to encode these values as a base64 string in the Authorization header of some requests. As a convenience, you can use [https://www.base64encode.org/](https://www.base64encode.org/) to generate the encoded string.

The pattern for the input string is `id:secret`. Using the client identifier and secret from above, our input string is `com.local.test:mysecret`.

After being encoded, these credentials are `Y29tLmxvY2FsLnRlc3Q6bXlzZWNyZXQ=`. If your client identifier and secret are different, this value will be different.

### Register a user (POST /register)

To register a new user, send a `POST /register` request. Use the following CURL command and replace the `<username>` and `<password>` with your own.


`curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/register -H 'Authorization: Basic Y29tLmxvY2FsLnRlc3Q6bXlzZWNyZXQ=' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"username":"<username>", "password": "<password>"}' -v`

You should see a response similar to this:

```JSON
{"id":3,"username":"marilyn","authorization":{"access_token":"cUXqbTn0DIogyzq80jl2FHmCBa8BvIAyww","token_type":"bearer","expires_in":86399,"refresh_token":"26o8xEOVKBfFvB3jg0rH8qnF2wWV9QBp"}}

```

For the next step, we will need the `access_token`, namely `cUXqbTn0DIogyzq80jl2FHmCBa8BvIAyww` from above. Note that when you run this, you will have a different `access_token`.

### Get User Profile (GET /me)

To read information about yourself, once you have the `access_token` from the previous step above, you can run this CURL:

```
curl -X GET http://localhost:8888/me -H 'Authorization: Bearer cUXqbTn0DIogyzq80jl2FHmCBa8BvIAy'
```

Notice the bearer token is the access token from a previous request, and not the base64 encoded client credentials. You should see a response similar to this:

```JSON
{"id":1,"username":"marilyn"}
```

### Read a specific User (GET /users/[:id])

For this example, we will use the end point `/users/[:id]`. In our example, our first user was `marilyn` and the record was created with the `id` of `1`. Again, referencing the `access_token` from above, we have this CURL:

```
curl -X GET http://localhost:8888/users/1 -H 'Authorization: Bearer cUXqbTn0DIogyzq80jl2FHmCBa8BvIAy'
```

You should see a response similar to this:

```JSON
{"id":1,"username":"marilyn"}
```

### Read all users (GET /users)

For this example, we will be hitting the same end point as above, namely `/users/[:id]` but we will not provide the `id`. By doing so, we will retrieve all the Users. Again, we will reference the `access_token` from above. We now have this CURL:

```
curl -X GET http://localhost:8888/users -H 'Authorization: Bearer cUXqbTn0DIogyzq80jl2FHmCBa8BvIAy'
```

You should have a response similar to the following. Note that the JSON object is contained in a Array.

```JSON
[{"id":1,"username":"marilyn"}]
```

### Update a User (PUT /users/[:id])

For this example, we will update our User. We can only update our own user. So we will need 2 things to be in sync, namely the `id` of the user and the `access_token` for that user. In our case, user `marilyn` has `access_token` of `cUXqbTn0DIogyzq80jl2FHmCBa8BvIAy` and she is `id` of `1`.

Here is the CURL command:

```
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8888/users/1 -H 'Authorization: Bearer cUXqbTn0DIogyzq80jl2FHmCBa8BvIAy'  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "bob roy"}'
```

You should see a response similar to the following:

```JSON
{"id":1,"username":"bob roy"}
```

### Delete a User (DELETE /users/[id])

For this example, we will delete our User. We can only delete our own user. So we will need 2 things to be in sync, namely the `id` of the user and the `access_token` for that user. In our case, user `bob roy` has `access_token` of `cUXqbTn0DIogyzq80jl2FHmCBa8BvIAy`. So here is the CURL command:

```
curl -X GET http://localhost:8888/users/1 -H 'Authorization: Bearer cUXqbTn0DIogyzq80jl2FHmCBa8BvIAy'
```

For this command, there is no CURL output. To validate the record is deleted, try fetching it again with `GET /users/1`.

### Get a Auth Token for a User (POST /auth/token)

This is a 'login' request that requires a user to already be registered. Client credentials are provided in the Authorization header, and user credentials in the body (in the query string format, not JSON).

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/auth/token -H 'Authorization: Basic Y29tLmxvY2FsLnRlc3Q6bXlzZWNyZXQ=' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -d 'username=marilyn&password=password&grant_type=password'

```

You should see a response similar to the following:

```JSON
{"access_token":"kliJ8X6Rf9OCw31qbkTFzZhwBQ5n5MgA","token_type":"bearer","expires_in":86399,"refresh_token":"73Awjp9zzTWnmEGnuz7hIBFBaXahFPLt"}
```

## Swqgger UI Client

To generate a SwaggerUI client, run `aqueduct document client`.

## Running Application Tests

To run all tests for this application, run the following in this directory. Remember, the tests assume the database to be `dart_test`.

```
pub run test
```

The default configuration file used when testing is `config.src.yaml`. This file should be checked into version control. It also the template for configuration files used in deployment.

## Deploying an Application

See the documentation for [Deployment](https://aqueduct.io/docs/deploy/).
