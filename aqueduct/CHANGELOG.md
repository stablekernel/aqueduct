## 3.2.2-dev

- [#723](https://github.com/stablekernel/aqueduct/pull/723) Fixes issue that prevented the `AuthServer` from granting tokens with sub-scopes when the servers `AuthServerDelegate.getAllowedScopes()` didn't return `AuthScope.any`.
- Deprecates `AuthScope.allowsScope()`, use `AuthScope.isSubsetOrEqualTo()` instead.

## 3.2.1

- Fixes issue when using `QueryReduce` inside a transaction.
- Fixes issue when generating an OpenAPI document with ManagedObjects that have enumerated properties
- Fixes issue when generating an OpenAPI document with List<Serializable> bound to a request body

- Fixes issues with Dart 2.1.1 mirror type checking changes
- Adds `like` matcher expression
- Escapes postgres special characters in LIKE expressions for all other string matcher expressions
- Fixes security vulnerability where a specific authorization header value would be associated with the wrong token in rare cases (credit to Philipp Schiffmann)
- Adds `Validate.constant` to properties that use the `@primaryKey` annotation.
- Allows `Validate` annotations to be added to belongs-to relationship properties; the validation is run on the foreign key.
- Allows any type - e.g. `Map<String, dynamic>` - to be bound with `Bind.body`.

## 3.1.0

- Adds the implicit authorization grant flow via the `AuthRedirectController` type.

- ORM: Renamed `Query.matchOn` to `Query.where`.
- ORM: Removed `includeInResultSet` for `Query`'s, instead, added `joinOn` and `joinMany` which create subqueries that can be configured further.

## 1.0.4
- BREAKING CHANGE: Added new `Response.contentType` property. Adding "Content-Type" to the headers of a `Response` no longer has any effect; use this property instead.
- `ManagedDataModel`s now scan all libraries for `ManagedObject<T>` subclasses to generate a data model. Use `ManagedDataModel.fromCurrentMirrorSystem` to create instances of `ManagedDataModel`.
- The *last* instantiated `ManagedContext` now becomes the `ManagedContext.defaultContext`; prior to this change, it was the first instantiated context. Added `ManagedContext.standalone` to opt out of setting the default context.
