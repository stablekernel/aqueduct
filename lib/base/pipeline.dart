  /// properties that will be used throughout the callbacks executed during initialization. For any code that requires async initialization,
  /// use [willOpen]. However, it is important to note that any properties that are used during initialization callbacks (like [addRoutes]) should be
  /// initialized in this constructor and not during [willOpen]. If properties that are needed during initialization callbacks
  /// must be initialized asynchronously, those properties should implement their own deferred initialization mechanism
  /// that can be triggered in [willOpen], but still must be initialized in this constructor.
