/// Instances of this type are the root of an Aqueduct application.
///
/// [Application]s set up HTTP(S) listeners, but do not do anything with them. The behavior of how an application
/// responds to requests is defined by its [RequestSink]. Must be subclassed. This class must be visible
/// to the application library file for tools like `aqueduct serve` to run Aqueduct applications.
///
/// A [RequestSink] must implement its constructor and [setupRouter]. HTTP requests to the [Application] are added to a [RequestSink]
/// for processing. The path the HTTP request takes is determined by the [RequestController] chains in [setupRouter]. A [RequestSink]
/// is also a [RequestController], but will always forward HTTP requests on to its [initialController].
///
/// Multiple instances of this type will be created for an [Application], each processing requests independently. Initialization code for
/// a [RequestSink] instance happens in the constructor, [setupRouter] and [willOpen] - in that order. The constructor instantiates resources,
/// [setupRouter] sets up routing and [willOpen] performs any tasks that occur asynchronously, like opening database connections. These initialization
/// steps occur for every instance of [RequestSink] in an application.
///
/// Any initialization that occurs once per application cannot
/// be performed in one of above methods. Instead, one-time initialization must be performed by implementing a static method in the
/// [RequestSink] subclass named `initializeApplication`. This method gets executed once when an application starts, prior to instances of [RequestSink]
/// being created. This method takes an [ApplicationConfiguration],
/// and may attach values to its [ApplicationConfiguration.options] for use by the [RequestSink] instances. This method is often used to
/// read configuration values from a file.
///
/// The signature of this method is ([ApplicationConfiguration]) -> [Future], for example:
///
///         class MyRequestSink extends RequestSink {
///           static Future initializeApplication(ApplicationConfiguration config) async {
///             // Do one-time setup here, e.g read configuration values from a file
///             var configurationValuesFromFile = ...;
///             config.options = configurationValuesFromFile;
///           }
///           ...
///         }
///

  /// This method is invoked as the first step during application startup. It is only invoked once per application, whereas other initialization
  /// methods are invoked once per isolate. Implement this method in an application's [RequestSink] subclass. This method is often used to

  ///
  ///         class MyRequestSink extends RequestSink {

  ///             var configurationValuesFromFile = ...;
  ///             config.options = configurationValuesFromFile;

  /// is for documentation purposes..
