Aqueduct has a built in tool, `aqueduct`, for deploying Aqueduct applications, managing database schemas, OAuth 2.0 clients and creating projects. See [Getting Started](getting_started.html) for installation instructions. Many of the tasks for deployment rely on using this tool.

Aqueduct applications can be run anywhere that Dart can be installed. This topic covers deployment tasks on common hosting services. If you are just getting started or a hobbyist, you should consider using [Heroku](http://heroku.com) to host your applications.
