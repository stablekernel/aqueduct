Aqueduct's aim is to make developers productive, and testing is an important part of being productive. Therefore, Aqueduct has a number of helpful utilities for testing an application.

Aqueduct tests start a local server and connect to a temporary, local database. Requests are issued in tests with a `TestClient` that makes configuring requests simple. Specialized test matchers - in the Hamcrest matcher style - validate request responses and can be mix and matched with the official Dart test package matchers.
