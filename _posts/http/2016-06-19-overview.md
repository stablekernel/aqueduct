Aqueduct responds to HTTP requests. The primary components of handling HTTP requests are as follows:

- Using a `Router` to dispatch `Request`s to a `RequestController`
- Managing a stream of `Request`s that `RequestController`s either respond to or pass to another controller
- Subclassing `RequestSink` to provide initialization and an entry point for HTTP requests into an application
- Creating `Application` instances and spreading them across isolates (threads)
- Using `HTTPController`s to respond to requests
- Using more focused `RequestController`s like `ManagedObjectController` and `QueryController`
- Decoding HTTP request bodies and encoding objects into HTTP response bodies
- Handling CORS requests
