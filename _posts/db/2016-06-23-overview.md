Aqueduct has an ORM to store data in a database and map database data to Dart objects.

- Defining a data model by declaring `ManagedObject<T>` subclasses
- Inserting, updating, reading and deleting data from a database with `Query<T>`.
- Creating `ManagedObject<T>`s from HTTP request body data like JSON
- Encoding `ManagedObject<T>`s into an HTTP response body
- Generating and upgrading database schemas with the `aqueduct db` tool.
