Aqueduct has built-in classes to manage authentication and authorization according to the [OAuth 2.0 specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749).  To manage authentication and authorization, the following tasks are required/suggested:

- Creating `AuthServer` instances to enable OAuth 2.0 in an Aqueduct application
- Using `aqueduct/managed_auth` to manage storage of authorization objects, e.g. storing tokens in a database.
- Using `AuthCodeController` and `AuthController` to expose endpoints for exchanging credentials for authorization tokens.
- Adding `Authorizer`s to a series of `RequestController`s to allow only authorized requests.
- Creating OAuth 2.0 Client Identifiers through the `aqueduct auth` tool
